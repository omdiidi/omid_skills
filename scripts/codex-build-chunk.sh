# codex-build-chunk.sh — the ONLY sanctioned way to let Codex WRITE code.
#
# Everywhere else in this repo Codex runs `-s read-only`. This wrapper is the single exception, and
# it exists because the permission was already half-written into /mission ("hand a mechanical chunk
# to Codex") while every invocation still pinned `-s read-only` - a licence that could not execute.
#
# THE RULE IT SPLITS (mission.md 6.5):
#   * Codex NEVER writes the mission bridge.        <- absolute, unchanged, enforced below
#   * Codex MAY implement an isolated, mechanical, well-specified chunk.   <- new, this script
#
# WHY A LINKED WORKTREE IS MANDATORY (the load-bearing safety property).
# `-s workspace-write` makes the `-C` directory writable. In a MAIN working tree, `.git/` lives
# INSIDE that directory - and the mission bridge artifacts (MISSION.<sid>.md, .mission-backups/)
# live at the canonical root beside it. Pointing this at a main tree therefore hands Codex write
# access to the bridge and to git's own state, which is exactly the thing the absolute half of the
# rule forbids. In a LINKED worktree the real gitdir is `<canonical-root>/.git/worktrees/<name>`,
# OUTSIDE the writable root, so the sandbox boundary does the enforcing rather than a promise.
# So: linked worktrees only, asserted, no override.
#
# Codex must not run git either. That is instructed in the prompt AND verified after the fact -
# HEAD, the branch, and the index must be unchanged - because an instruction alone is not a control.
#
# Usage: codex-build-chunk.sh <promptfile> <outfile> <worktree-dir>
#   Env: CODEX_EFFORT, CODEX_TIMEOUT_SECS  - same contract as codex-exec.sh.
#        CODEX_BUILD_CHUNK_CMD  - test seam ONLY: the command run in place of `codex`.
#
# Writes: <outfile> (model output), <outfile>.status  (ok | refused-<reason> | timeout |
#         unavailable | no-changes | nonzero-<rc>)
#
# Exit 0 ONLY when Codex ran, git state is untouched, the bridge is untouched, and the worktree
# actually changed. ZERO changed files is a FAILURE, not an ok - a silent no-op that reads as
# success is how a build step gets believed without having built anything.
#
# The output is NOT trusted work. Claude runs the tests on it before it counts for anything.
#
# NO Claude fallback here (unlike the review wrappers): when Codex is missing this stays
# `unavailable`, and /implement and /mission route the chunk to the Claude `implementer` agent.
