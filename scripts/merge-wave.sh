# merge-wave.sh - INCREMENTAL, RESUMABLE integration of one write wave.
#
# usage: merge-wave.sh <wave-state.json>
#
# SCHEMA AUTHORITY: docs/wave-plan-schema.md (wave_state = s5, event = s7).
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Re-verifies the wave INLINE via verify-parallel-wave.mjs --wave-state. A nonzero
#      verdict exits with that exact code and merges NOTHING.
#   2. Merges each chunk branch in DECLARED order with --no-ff, skipping ids already in
#      merged_chunks[], and records {id, merge_sha} back into the wave-state VIA NODE
#      (read-modify-write to <state>.tmp then rename - no jq dependency, and no partial JSON
#      if the process dies mid-write).
#   3. Emits ONE outcome event per run (merge failure, or success).
#
# Failure semantics are pinned to what the assumption tests actually proved
# (a dedicated merge-wave failure-semantics assumption script):
#   - `git merge --abort` ERRORS when no merge is in progress, and an untracked-file
#     collision makes git refuse BEFORE starting the merge (no MERGE_HEAD). So the abort is
#     conditional on MERGE_HEAD existing - a blanket abort would turn a clean refusal into a
#     confusing second error.
#   - Either way the tree ends CLEAN at the last successful merge tip. Earlier merges stay,
#     by design: that is what makes a re-run a RESUME rather than a restart.
#
# NEVER deletes a worktree or a branch. Teardown is barrier step (d)'s job, after the gates.
