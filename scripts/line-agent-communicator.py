"""
line-agent-communicator — one command names a window three ways at once.

Claude Code keeps two unrelated names for every window:

  1. the statusline caption   ~/.claude/session-status/<sessionId>.txt   (cosmetic; /line wrote this)
  2. the peer address         ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json .name        (what ListAgents shows and
                                                                          SendMessage resolves)

Because nothing joined them, a window you called "billing admin hub" was addressable only as
"myapp-ae", and no agent could make that leap. This script closes the gap: `set` writes BOTH,
deriving a short handle from your sentence, so the name you type IS the address other agents use.

`list` is the directory half — it enumerates every live window with its caption, its address, and
whether it can actually receive a message, so an agent can find a peer on its own.

On writing .name directly
-------------------------
Setting the peer address is not a documented API; the supported paths are `claude -n <name>` at
startup and `/rename` typed by a human. Neither can be driven by a slash command, so this writes the
registry file itself. That is safe in practice but unsupported in principle, so every write here is
defensive: we locate our own file by sessionId (never by pid guessing or mtime), preserve every
field we do not own, write atomically, and no-op rather than corrupt if the schema ever changes
shape. Verified on 2.1.227/2.1.228: the harness re-saves the file on each status change and
PRESERVES a name carrying nameSource="explicit" — that is the flag that marks a name as
human-chosen rather than auto-derived, and it is why this survives.

If a future version stops honouring it, `set` degrades to caption-only and says so; the caption and
the directory keep working, so discovery never silently breaks.

On what this script does NOT do
-------------------------------
It never authenticates a sender, and nothing it prints should be read as vouching for one.
`whois <pid>` is an UNAUTHENTICATED registry lookup on two independent counts:

  - the pid, because whois is handed an integer and cannot see where it came from (a kernel peer
    credential on a local unix socket is evidence; a pid copied out of a message body is a claim by
    its author; both arrive as the same integer, which is what `--transport` exists to distinguish);
  - the NAME, always and regardless of transport, because every name/caption/cwd comes out of
    ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json - a plain file any local process running as this user can write.
    Nothing here asks the kernel what a process IS; is_claude_process() only asks `ps` for a comm
    whose basename is "claude", which any binary launched under that name satisfies. A kernel peer
    credential pins the process; it does not name it.

Reachability is NOT a provenance signal and is never used as one.

Everything read out of the reply dropbox or the shared notes is peer-authored and is treated as
hostile input: each item is printed inside its OWN untrusted-data frame with our banner strings
neutralised inside the content, symlinks are refused rather than followed, and both the per-item
size and the item COUNT are capped.

    Is this pid a Claude Code window - not merely a process that lives somewhere near one?

    OBSERVED on macOS 26 (2026-08-12), and the reason the old substring test was wrong:
      - all 17 real live windows report `ps -p <pid> -o comm=` as exactly "claude" (bare basename,
        no path), even though the installed binary lives under ~/.local/share/claude/versions/;
      - a process exec'd BY PATH reports the FULL exec path instead - the assumption suite's decoy
        comes back as ".../claude-decoy/home/zzsleep".
    The old check was `"claude" in comm.lower()`, so that decoy - and anything else running from
    under ~/.claude/, ~/.claude-kit/, or any claude-named checkout - passed as a live window.

    So we match on the BASENAME. Matching the whole path over-matches (the bug); matching only the
    literal string "claude" with no path handling would reject a window exec'd by absolute path.
    The versions/<version> form is accepted too, because the install layout puts the real binary
    there and its basename is a version string rather than "claude" - rejecting every real window
    would be the same self-inflicted outage in the other direction.

    Tri-state: None means `ps` could not answer, so the question is unanswered rather than answered
    "no". Returning False there would delete every live window from the directory on any ps failure.

    NOT A SECURITY CHECK. This is hygiene against pid REUSE - "did this pid get recycled onto some
    unrelated process" - and nothing more. Any local process can be launched under the name
    `claude` and pass it, so a True here is never evidence that the registry entry's NAME is real.

# agent" unanswerable the moment that window closes - indistinguishable from a name that never
# existed. Contacts is the remembered half: every window we have ever seen named, with when we
# last saw it. It turns "no such agent" into "that one is closed, last seen Tuesday", which is
# the difference between a dead end and a next step.
#
# It is a cache, never an authority. Reachability is always recomputed from the live registry,
# so a stale contact can misname a window but can never make a dead one look alive.

    Read out what the registry FILE claims about a pid. This identifies nobody.

    Usage: whois <pid> [--transport socket|bridge] [--claims "<what they called themselves>"]

    THERE IS NO OUTPUT OF THIS COMMAND THAT VOUCHES FOR ANYONE, and that is the whole design.
    Two separate things are unproven here, and an earlier version conflated them:

      1. THE PID. This command receives a pid as an argument and cannot see where it came from. A
         pid read out of a KERNEL peer credential on a local unix socket is evidence about which
         PROCESS is on the far end; a pid copied out of a message BODY is a claim by whoever wrote
         the body. Both arrive here as the same integer, so --transport is the only distinction.
      2. THE NAME - and this one is unproven NO MATTER WHAT THE TRANSPORT DID. Every name, caption
         and cwd printed below is read out of ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json, a plain file any local
         process running as this user can write. Nothing here consults the kernel about the
         process: is_claude_process() only asks `ps` for a comm whose basename is "claude", which
         is satisfied by launching any binary under that name. A reviewer did exactly that - a
         renamed /bin/sleep plus a hand-written registry entry - and an earlier version of this
         command answered `IDENTITY (attested)` for a process called `payments-owner` that was
         nothing of the kind. A kernel peer credential pins the PROCESS; it does not name it, and
         the name is the part an agent acts on.

    So the framing is a LOOKUP, always, and --transport only changes how much the pid itself is
    worth. Reachability is never used as a provenance proxy - it answers "has a socket bound",
    which is a different question from "did this message arrive over one".

      2. DUPLICATES. Two live windows can carry the same name; it returned whichever the directory
         listed first - a coin flip. An ambiguous name is now refused with both candidates named.

    Every returned sessionId passes through safe_sid(). The sessionId comes from a file written by

    them and drifted: after the loss described below it reported "0 removed" for files it had just
    helped delete, so nothing ever reported the loss.

    THE RULE THAT MATTERS: an unread reply is never reaped, at any age. "Read" means what `replies`
    means by it, and that is now TWO conditions, not one:

      1. the file's mtime is at or before this recipient's last-read mark, AND
      2. the file was actually DISPLAYED.

    (2) is not redundant. `replies` shows at most MAX_ENTRY_FILES; with 25 replies it printed
    "Showing the newest 20; 5 older not shown" and then this function deleted those 5 in the same
    invocation, because their mtimes are BELOW the mark and the mark was all it looked at. Two
    independent guards now stop that, deliberately belt-and-braces on a mailbox whose whole purpose
    is guaranteed delivery:

      * STATE: the recorded floor - the oldest mtime ever displayed to this sid. Anything older was
        never shown, so it is spared. Absent (a pre-existing state file) = 0 = unknown, in which case
        this guard abstains and the next one still holds.
      * STRUCTURE: only the newest MAX_ENTRY_FILES per sid are eligible at all, because that is the
        most `replies` can ever have put in front of someone. This needs no state to be right. It can
        spare a file that WAS displayed once (it has since been pushed out of the window by newer
        arrivals) - sparing is the safe direction; deleting is not.

    A window that has never run `replies` (no mark) has nothing reaped, and a MISFILED reply
    addressed to a sessionId nobody holds is unread by definition and therefore immortal. Skipped
    without comment: symlinks (never followed, and `replies` reports them as an attack signal worth

        /line "billing" --owns "Stripe webhooks + invoice reconciliation"

    Fixed HERE rather than in the slash command because the alternative is `eval` on user prose in
    a bash block - re-splitting arbitrary text through the shell to recover quoting we already
    have. Parsing it in Python is the same job with no injection surface.

    Deliberately narrow: it engages only when the literal `--owns` is present, and it declines
    (returning the text untouched) on unbalanced quotes rather than guessing. The trade is that a
