#!/bin/bash
# line-reassert-identity.sh — async SessionStart hook (startup|resume|clear|compact).
#
# Re-applies this window's PEER ADDRESS from its `/line` caption after a restart.
# On a real open (startup|resume) it also restores the DISPLAY NAME (what Remote Control shows on
# the other Macs, = the peer handle) when the transcript's last custom-title record no longer matches: the
# record is re-appended and a /rename request is left for the Stop hook line-apply-rename.sh.
#
# Why it exists: the two names a window carries are keyed differently. The caption lives at
# ~/.claude/session-status/<sessionId>.txt and SURVIVES a resume; the peer address lives in
# ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json and is re-derived by the harness under the NEW pid. So a resumed
# window keeps its caption while its address silently reverts to an auto-generated handle —
# observed live: the window captioned "billing admin hub" came back addressable only as
# `myapp-f9` with nameSource=derived, which is precisely the caption-vs-address divergence
# /line was built to end. Without this hook the fix decays on every restart.
#
# Posture: fail-open everywhere. A hook that breaks session start is worse than a stale name, so
# every failure path exits 0 silently and prints nothing on stdout even on success (this runs async,
# and a name re-assert is not news). It is NOT silent to disk: see the log below.

# export into hook processes, so it was a permanent no-op that nobody could have noticed (the
# window captioned "billing admin hub" was still nameSource=derived). One line per re-assert makes
# the hook provable; bounded so it can never grow without limit.

# `.session_id` off stdin, stale-handoff-guard.sh does the same — because that is the channel the
# harness actually populates for hooks. $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID is what a Bash TOOL call inherits (which
# is why /line reads it); a hook process is not a tool call. Reading env only made this hook a
# silent no-op. stdin is bounded to 1MB, matching post-compact-primer.sh's DoS guard.
#
# Either way it is the harness's own id — never a transcript-mtime guess, which loses the race
# against sibling tabs and can re-assert one window's name onto another.

# load_sessions() already has — so `jq -s` over the glob is not an option here.
#
# What IS fixed is the cost of NOT finding it. The old shape was jq-per-file inside the retry loop:
# 19 session files x 6 attempts = 114 jq processes at session start, all of it on the path where
# the entry does not exist yet. A single `grep -l` narrows the directory to the one file that even
# mentions this sessionId, so each attempt costs 1 grep (+1 jq if there was a hit) instead of 19
# jq. grep is a prefilter ONLY — jq still decides, because a sessionId can appear in a field we do
# not mean (bridgeSessionId), and a substring match must never be allowed to name a window.
