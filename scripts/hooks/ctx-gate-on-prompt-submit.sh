# ctx-gate-on-prompt-submit.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook: three-tier context nudge.
#
# Execution context: this is a Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook script.
# It runs as a direct subprocess of Claude Code, NOT through the orchestrator Bash tool.
#
# Threshold model (2026-05-28 tuning — code-quality-first):
#   <50%   → silent (no output)
#   50-64% → SOFT nudge (seam-opportunistic; checkpoint at a natural seam, don't interrupt mid-task)
#   65-74% → IMPORTANT nudge (finish current task, then invoke /pre-compact)
#   ≥75%   → FORCE nudge (FIRST action MUST be Skill(pre-compact) — context-critical)
#
# **Zone-bucket rate-limit (2026-05-28):** SOFT and IMPORTANT fire only when the 5% bucket
# changes (50/55/60/65/70 etc.), not on every user prompt. FORCE always fires every turn
# (action-required; persistent reminder is correct). Marker file at
# `~/.claude/progress/.ctx-zone-bucket-<sid>` records the last bucket the hook fired in;
# per-session, GC'd by the existing 720-min cleanup glob on `~/.claude/progress/`.
#
# NEVER uses `permissionDecision: deny` or `decision: block`.
# Only additionalContext. Fail-open on any error so a buggy gate never breaks prompts.
#
# FORCE overrides sentinel-fresh skip AND the bucket rate-limit — operator must see
# context-critical alerts on every turn. SOFT and IMPORTANT respect sentinel-fresh skip
# (already ran /pre-compact; no noise) AND the bucket rate-limit.
