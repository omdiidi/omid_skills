# Stop hook - catches a /mission run that ended a turn WITHOUT booking its next wake.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   mission.md's CONTINUATION-OWNER INVARIANT ("a mission turn NEVER yields naked") was enforced by
#   nothing. ScheduleWakeup is called only because the model remembers to call it, and the sole Stop
#   hook registered before this one (auto-compact-after-pre-compact.sh) exits without ever reading
#   mission state. A dropped step 7 froze the mission INDEFINITELY - no timer, no expiring lock, no
#   watcher - until a human typed something. Observed repeatedly: four stops in one session, every one
#   immediately after a git commit returned success.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   On a normal turn end, for an ARMED mission session only: read the session transcript, check whether
#   the just-ended assistant turn actually called ScheduleWakeup, and if it did not - and the mission is
#   not at a sanctioned stop - exit 2 to block the stop and tell the model to re-enter the wake routine.
#
# MECHANISM NOTES (verified against the 2.1.229 hooks reference, 2026-08-13)
#   - Stop blocks on EXIT CODE 2. That is the documented mechanism; `{"decision":"block"}` is a
#     PreToolUse/PreCompact shape and does NOT apply here.
#   - Exit 2 is absolute: multiple Stop handlers run in PARALLEL and the most restrictive wins.
#   - There is NO `session_crons` field and no way to query pending ScheduleWakeup entries from a hook.
#     The transcript is therefore the evidence: we observe whether the CALL was made. That is still an
#     effect, not a self-report - the distinction that makes this a guard rather than a wish.
#   - `stop_hook_active` is NOT documented for this version, so the loop bound is keyed on `prompt_id`.
#   - Stop does NOT fire on API errors / rate limits (those emit StopFailure, whose exit 2 is ignored),
#     so this cannot catch an allowance-exhaustion death. Known and accepted; see the plan's scorecard.
#
# SAFETY POSTURE - fail SILENT everywhere it is not certain:
#   unarmed session, auto-compact in flight, repeat on the same prompt_id, unreadable/lagging
#   transcript, unreadable mission state, any sanctioned stop => exit 0 and say nothing. The ONLY
#   loud paths are the block itself and the stall alert. A false block interrupts a human; a missed
#   block costs one wake. We bias to the latter.

set -uo pipefail   # no -e: partial failures must fall through to a silent exit, never abort loudly

# KILL SWITCH. Every other guard in this directory has one (CLAUDE_CTX_GATE_DISABLED,
# SHARED_PATH_GUARD_DISABLED) and those only SPEAK. This one refuses to let a turn end, so it needs
# an escape hatch more than they do: if it misfires at 3am the alternative recovery is hand-editing
# settings.json or deleting a sentinel whose path the user would have to already know.

# trapping the session.
#
# `prompt_id` REQUIRES 2.1.196+ and is therefore an assumption of exactly the same class as the
# undocumented `stop_hook_active` — load-bearing and outside our control. When it is ABSENT the
# per-prompt marker can never be written, the check can never trip, and the hook blocks EVERY time:
# an unbounded loop, reproduced three-for-three in review. So the absent case gets its own bound
# rather than silently losing one: a sid-keyed marker with a time window. Worst case is one block
# per window instead of one per prompt; it is never unbounded.
