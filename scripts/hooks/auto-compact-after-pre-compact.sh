#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Stop hook — fires /compact into the originating Terminal.app tab when /pre-compact armed it.
#
# Execution context: this is a Claude Code Stop hook script.
# It runs as a direct subprocess of Claude Code, NOT through the orchestrator Bash tool.
#
# Mechanism:
#   1. /pre-compact (via arm-auto-compact.sh) writes a per-session JSON sentinel containing
#      the originating tab's TTY and metadata.
#   2. On every model Stop, this hook claims its session's sentinel atomically (mv-to-lock),
#      looks up the matching Terminal.app tab via AppleScript, verifies `claude` is the
#      foreground process in that tab, then delivers `/compact` via `do script ... in <tab>`
#      (writes to the tab's PTY input — no keystroke synthesis, no focus race, no Accessibility
#      requirement, only Terminal Automation permission).
#
# Anti-loop (REVISED 2026-08-02 - retain-and-confirm):
#   The sentinel is moved (atomic claim) to a `.claim.<pid>` file before any external command.
#   The atomic mv prevents two concurrent Stop events from acting on the same sentinel (only
#   one mv succeeds). It is NO LONGER removed on a successful fire: "fired" means AppleScript
#   delivered the text, not that a compaction happened, and a `/compact` typed while the
#   session is busy is swallowed as an ordinary prompt. So the sentinel is RESTORED with an
#   incremented `.attempts` counter and the next Stop retries; post-compact-primer.sh retires
#   it on a confirmed source=compact start, which is the only real proof of effect. Bounded at
#   3 attempts so a tab that can never accept the command cannot spin.
#
# Security:
#   - TARGET_TTY passed to osascript via argv (NOT heredoc string interpolation).
#   - TTY validated against anchored regex `^/dev/ttys[0-9]+$`.
#   - Sentinel: symlink-rejected, size-bounded (4KB), schema-validated.
#   - Foreground-process check: `do script` only fires if the matched tab is running `claude`.
#
# Platform: macOS Terminal.app only. The arming step refuses to write a sentinel for
# non-Darwin / non-Terminal.app / tmux / screen, so this hook is naturally inert there.
#
# Uninstall: run `~/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/uninstall-auto-compact.sh`.
# Diagnostics: `~/.claude/logs/auto-compact.log` (bounded ring, last ~64KB).
