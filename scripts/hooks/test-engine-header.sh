#   1. codex-review.md's Engine-header emit literal (extracted from its ENGINE-HEADER-FORMAT fence)
#   2. the `parse-codex-header` VERB (the real mission-§5 call path through mission-write.sh —
#      NOT the lib function directly)
#   3. the dead-lens `.usable` counting rule (Step 3c's single predicate)
# Mangling either side (the fenced literal's shape, or the verb's parse) goes RED here.
