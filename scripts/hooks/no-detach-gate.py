PreToolUse gate - block a shell-detach wrapping a codex launch.

Why: an autonomous /mission that launches a review shell-detached
(`nohup codex ... &`) sees the wrapper exit in ~1s; the harness then tracks the
launcher, NOT codex. codex finishes orphaned and nothing wakes the idle agent -
the mission silently stalls (road 1 of the mission-stall root cause; one
observed session sat idle 3h38m). This nudges the agent to launch codex in the FOREGROUND of
a `run_in_background: true` Bash so its completion re-invokes the idle agent.

Design (a fail-open PreToolUse gate):
  * FAILS OPEN. The harm here is a false POSITIVE (wedging normal Bash), so ANY
    parse error, empty command, or unexpected exception -> allow(). This gate
    only ever BLOCKS on a confident positive match; it never fails closed.
  * NARROW + DOCUMENTED KNOWN-OPENS. It backstops the common literal
    nohup / & / disown / setsid forms wrapping a `codex` token. Bypasses
    (`bash -c '...'`, `( codex ) &` inside quotes, `$CODEX_BIN`, aliases,
    `& sleep`/`& somecmd`) are ACCEPTED and documented - it does not "remove
    discretion", it catches the foot-gun.
  * `wait` is deliberately NOT in the detach alternation: `codex & wait` blocks
    until codex exits, which is SAFE and must not be blocked.
  * `&&` is correctly allowed via the `(?<!&)` negative-lookbehind
    (e.g. `codex && echo` is a sequence, not a detach).

    # backgrounding: a `&` after the nohup that is not a redirect (`2>&1`, `>&`, `&>`) and not the
