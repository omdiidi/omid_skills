# test-mission-pending-reask.sh — regression harness for mission-pending-reask.sh
# (the UserPromptSubmit hook that re-asks a mission's open questions when the user comes back).
#
# Emits a final `PASS: N  FAIL: M` line and exits nonzero on any FAIL.
#
# HOUSE RULE: every assertion carries an
# explicit NEGATIVE CONTROL. This hook's default is SILENCE, so "it printed nothing" is the cheapest
# possible false green — a hook with `exit 0` on line 1 would pass every silence test in this file.
# Each silence case is therefore paired with a case that fires under the same fixture with only the
# guarded condition changed.
#
# Hermetic: per-test temp roots under $TMPDIR, sids namespaced by UNIQ, all state removed on exit.

# resolves its sibling hooks from $HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks by default; on any
# checkout not living there (CI, a linked worktree) that directory does not exist and the
# hook emits nothing, which surfaced as 13 of 21 cases failing with "missing <text>" - a
# LOCATION failure wearing the costume of a behaviour failure. Using the override the hook
# already exposes keeps the fix inside the harness: no production hook is edited. It also
# makes the harness properly hermetic - it now proves the copy it ships with rather than
# whatever happens to be installed in the developer's $HOME.
