# SessionStart hook: tell a window that peer replies are waiting for it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the reply dropbox (~/claude-agent-replies/) was write-only in practice.
# `line-agent-communicator.py reply` even says so out loud - "it is not delivered, they have to
# look" - and nothing, anywhere, ever looked. No hook, no prompt, no reminder. So a peer answers a
# question, marks its own task done believing it communicated, and the answer sits on disk unread
# forever. The dropbox exists precisely as the GUARANTEED path for a window that cannot receive
# SendMessage; a guaranteed path nobody reads is worse than no path, because the sender stops
# looking for another one. This closes the loop at the one moment a window is guaranteed to be
# listening: its own session start.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: print any reply CONTENT, or any filename, or any sender name.
# Reply bodies are peer-authored, untrusted, and may only ever enter an agent's context inside the
# untrusted-data frame that `replies` emits (per-item BEGIN/END banners, banner-defanging, size and
# count caps). Hook stdout is injected into session context RAW - so a hook that echoed one line of
# a reply body would be an unframed prompt-injection channel, and would hand an attacker a way to
# bypass every defense that command was built with. The count is the only safe thing to say.
#
# SILENCE INVARIANT: say NOTHING unless there is
# something to say. A hook that speaks at every session start is noise, and noise is skimmed - which
# is how the notice that actually matters gets missed. Zero replies -> zero output.
#
# `set -uo pipefail`, NOT -e: every path here must exit 0. A notice that fails a session start, or
# that aborts half-way through because jq is absent or the dropbox does not exist, has made a
# housekeeping convenience into an outage. -e would do exactly that on the first unlucky command.

# ONE source of truth for "unread". This does not re-derive the rule from the filesystem - it asks

# that `replies` uses. A hook with its own idea of unread would drift from the inbox it points at,
# and the first symptom would be a notice for replies that are not there.

# `replies-count` prints one integer and nothing else, on every path including its own failures.
# The bound is belt-and-braces: it does no ps probing and no network, so it is a directory scan.
