# shared-path-overwrite-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook on the Write tool.
# Invoked by Claude Code as a direct subprocess (stdin = the hook payload JSON) before
# every Write. Purpose: in shared, human-owned paths with NO undo, turn an overwrite into
# a reversible act by snapshotting the prior version to <file>.bak-<UTC-minute> first.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the concrete failure):
# An agent found errors in a relay prompt in ~/Downloads — a file authored by a
# DIFFERENT agent — offered twice to fix it, got no answer, and overwrote it in place with no
# backup. The original survived only because the acting agent still happened to hold the text in
# its context. That is luck, not a procedure. The rule now lives at
# rules/destructive-actions.md in the kit (linked into ~/.claude/rules/) ("Never destroy a prior version in a shared or
# human-owned path") — but a rule is prose in a context window and enforces nothing; an adversarial
# review of that very change set said so. The standing gate in rules/verify-by-mechanism.md allows
# machine-enforcement only when the failure is SILENT and the shape can RECUR. This one is both
# (nothing errors, nothing goes red, and any agent in any window can redo it tomorrow) — which is
# exactly why it earns a machine and most bugs do not.
#
# BOUNDED ON PURPOSE — this is not a policy engine:
#   * It NEVER blocks, denies, or asks. Many concurrent windows may run in front of this while the
#     user is away; a hook that stalls or refuses is far worse than the bug it prevents. Always
#     exit 0. It converts a destructive act into a reversible one; it does not police intent.
#   * Only $HOME/Downloads, $HOME/Desktop, $HOME/Documents — paths where a prior version exists
#     nowhere else once it is gone.
#   * NOT inside a git working tree, even under those roots. Version control already preserves the
#     prior version, and .bak files beside tracked work are clutter, not safety. That exemption
#     mirrors the SCOPE clause of rules/destructive-actions.md verbatim in intent.
#   * Fails OPEN on everything: no jq, unreadable payload, unset $HOME, unwritable dir, a directory
#     or ANY symlink as the target, a permission error on the copy. Any doubt -> exit 0.

# -e is deliberately OMITTED: under `set -e` a single non-fatal non-zero (a `grep` with no match, a
# `cp` onto a read-only dir, a `stat` on a vanished file) would abort mid-script with a non-zero
# status, which is the ONE outcome this hook must never produce. Failure has to fall through to the
# explicit `exit 0` at the bottom, so every step is individually guarded instead.

# overwrites. Worse, head closing the pipe early gave the writer EPIPE (a 600KB producer died with
# BrokenPipeError), so we stopped reading mid-payload on every large Write.

# to preserve, so there is nothing to lose by skipping. The sibling dropbox code (line-agent-

#   * only runs right after WE took a backup (rare + already-warm path, never a cost on the hot path);
#   * only in $DIR_CANON, which is already proven to be inside a guarded root and outside any git tree;
#   * only names matching *.bak-<YYYYmmddTHHMMZ> - the exact shape THIS hook writes - and never a
#     symlink or a directory;
#   * age comes from the STAMP IN THE NAME, not mtime: `cp -p` preserves the ORIGINAL file's mtime, so
#     an mtime-based prune (`find -mtime +N`) would delete a backup of an old file the moment it was
#     taken. The stamp is fixed-width UTC, so a lexical compare is a chronological one.
# Fail-soft throughout: any missing tool or unreadable entry just leaves the file alone.
