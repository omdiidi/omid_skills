# Uninstall the auto-compact-after-pre-compact feature.
# Reverses the wiring without deleting source files (those are owned by the kit repo).
#
# Removes:
#   - The Stop hook entry from ~/.claude/settings.json (the second entry pointing to
#     auto-compact-after-pre-compact.sh)
#   - Any active sentinels in ~/.claude/progress/auto-compact-*.json
#   - The log at ~/.claude/logs/auto-compact.log
#
# Does NOT remove:
#   - The hook script itself (~/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/auto-compact-after-pre-compact.sh)
#   - The arming script (~/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/arm-auto-compact.sh)
#   - The Step 9.0 block in pre-compact.md (the skill detects no hook is registered and
#     reports "NOT armed" gracefully)
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run.

# AND unrelated hooks, we filter the inner array instead so we don't drop the other hooks.
