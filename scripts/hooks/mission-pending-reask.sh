#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mission-pending-reask.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook. Re-surface a mission's OPEN questions
# the moment the user comes back, so an autonomous run's recorded questions are actually
# ASKED instead of quietly accumulating in a file nobody opens.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The rule for an away run is: never idle behind a question — write it down and
# move to work that does not need the answer — and once the user is back, the agent must actually
# ask it. Nothing implemented the second half. A
# question written to PENDING DECISIONS at 3am was, in practice, never asked: the next morning's
# turn resumed mid-build and the zone was never read. UserPromptSubmit is the one event that
# means "a human is here right now", so that is where the re-ask belongs.
#
# CONTRACT (fail-open, silent by default):
#   * ALWAYS exits 0. It must never block a prompt — a hook that can swallow the user's turn is
#     worse than a missed question. Every failure path is `exit 0` with no output.
#   * Emits NOTHING when there is nothing to ask. Silence is the overwhelmingly common case and
#     an unconditional preamble would be pure noise on every prompt.
#   * Gated FIRST on the per-sid arming sentinel (~/.claude/progress/mission-liveness-<sid>.json,
#     the same file mission-liveness.sh uses): an unarmed session exits before any git/lib work.
#   * Resolves the mission STRICTLY BY SID via mission_resolve_path — never by cwd, never by
#     mtime, never another session's file. Several windows routinely sit in the same repo.
#   * Throttled to once per (session, pd-id-set): re-asking the same unanswered question on every
#     prompt is nagging, not helpfulness. A NEW question re-fires immediately because the id-set
#     changed. Bucket-marker idiom borrowed from ctx-gate-on-prompt-submit.sh.
#   * Injected question text is UNTRUSTED RECORDED DATA and is framed as such, byte-capped.
