# test-mission-doc-drift.sh — pins commands/mission.md against silent drift.
#
# WHY. mission.md is a CONTRACT the model executes, and its two recurring failure modes are both
# silent: (a) a rule stated three times in three places, so a fix lands in one and the other two keep
# instructing the old behaviour; (b) prose that CLAIMS a machine enforces something the machine does
# not actually enforce, which reads as a guarantee and is a wish. Neither shows up as a red test
# anywhere else - the doc always "works".
#
# So the load-bearing assertions here are the DOC <-> CODE ones: where mission.md says
# `mission-write.sh` refuses something, this file greps the actual enforcement out of
# mission-write.sh. If someone deletes the guard, the doc's claim goes red.
#
# Emits a final `PASS: N  FAIL: M` line and exits nonzero on any FAIL.
