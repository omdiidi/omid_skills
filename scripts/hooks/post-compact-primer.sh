# Source-routing primer for all session-start sources.

# Decision E: fires for compact (post-compact nav), resume/startup/clear (pending-handoff
# detection or session-start nav). Removes the hard-gate to compact-only.
#
# Execution context: this is a Claude Code SessionStart hook script.
# It runs as a direct subprocess of Claude Code, NOT through the orchestrator Bash tool.
#
# Fail-open on any error (exits 0, no output) so a buggy hook never breaks session start.
