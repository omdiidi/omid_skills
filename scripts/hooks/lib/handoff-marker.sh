# Write-protocol invariant: the pre-compact writer appends the END-OF-HANDOFF
# marker exactly ONCE at the very end of the file and nothing modifies the file
# after that. Therefore, within any well-formed handoff file there is exactly
# ONE marker line. head -1 is used instead of tail -1 throughout to defend
# against an attacker who appends a second marker line AFTER the canonical one:
# head -1 picks the FIRST (canonical) marker, ignoring any appended impostor.
# An attacker who PREPENDS a second marker before the canonical one would win
# head -1 — but the write protocol writes the canonical marker LAST and
# nothing external to the pre-compact pipeline modifies the file between arm
# time and ingestion. handoff_marker_count() logs a warning when count > 1 so
# operators can detect tampered files; ingestion still proceeds (defense-in-depth).
#
# Source-guard: second sourcing is a no-op.

# Scans the whole file (bounded by HANDOFF_MAX_SIZE_BYTES = 5MB at caller level)
# rather than the last 512 bytes. The 512-byte tail window was replaced because
# a marker placed earlier in the file (e.g., during partial writes, interrupted
# runs, or test fixtures) was invisible to tail -c 512. Whole-file grep is safe
# because: (a) HANDOFF_MAX_SIZE_BYTES = 5MB prevents DoS at the size-check gate
# in step2.sh before handoff_marker_check is called, and (b) grep -qF short-
# circuits on the first match — it does not scan past the marker line.
#
# Uses subprocess pipe — safe for hook scripts and orchestrator Bash tool calls
# below the hard-gate threshold. For orchestrator Bash AT the hard gate, callers
# should use the Read tool + in-memory grep instead of calling this function.

# C1+C3 fix: extracts the sid= attribute from the END-OF-HANDOFF marker line.
# Prints the sid8 value on success; prints nothing on failure (file absent,
# no marker, or no sid= attribute).
# Attribute extraction is order-insensitive within the marker line.
# The sid= attribute value uses the same safe charset as SID8: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+
# (double-underscore separator is preserved since _ is in that set).
#
# R3-fix-sweep C1: BSD sed doesn't recognize \b word-boundary — the old
# implementation silently returned empty on macOS. Fixed by anchoring extraction
# to the marker line (via grep -F) so \b is no longer needed.
# R3-fix-sweep C3+C4: same anchor-to-marker-line approach defeats body-injection.
