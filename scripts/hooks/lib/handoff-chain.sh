#!/usr/bin/env bash
# handoff-chain.sh — chain manifest + append-only ledger primitives for /pre-compact's
# overnight-autonomy story.
#
# Single authority used by THREE callers:
#   - commands/pre-compact.md     (writer:  Step 3.B reads/writes manifest, appends ledger)
#   - scripts/hooks/post-compact-primer.sh  (reader: prepends chain banner to SessionStart advisory)
#   - (future) any consumer that wants to inspect chain state
#
# DESIGN INVARIANT — observational, not gating: NOTHING in this lib refuses or blocks. A failed
# manifest write logs a warning and returns non-zero; callers MUST treat that as advisory and
# continue. The handoff file is the load-bearing artifact; manifest/ledger are recovery aids.
#
# Schema (slim, post-3-reviewer reconciliation): the manifest is these 10 fields:
#   chain_id, started_at, north_star, north_star_source, current_seq,
#   last_handoff_path, last_heartbeat_at, status, host, mission_path
# mission_path (additive) = absolute path to the mission file MISSION.<sid>.md at the
#   canonical root; empty string when handoff_canonical_root is unavailable.
# Corrupt-recovery paths add: recovered_from_ledger (true).
# Dropped (YAGNI): north_star_history, status_history, total_links.
#
# Ledger schema (locked TSV positions, key=value prefix on positions 2-9):
#   1=<iso_ts>  2=seq=<N>  3=ctx_pct=<%>  4=elapsed=<HhMm>  5=status=<S>
#   6=next=<one-line-up-to-120>  7=files=<N>  8=commits=<N>  9=north_star_first_120=<…>
# Field 9 lets corrupted-manifest recovery reconstruct the goal.
#
# macOS bash 3.2.57 compatible (no mapfile, no associative arrays). No ctx_gate_log dependency.

# 1 AND 2 ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, and conflating them is a data-loss bug (found in the
# round-5 review, 2026-08-04). When the "recovery failed" case was first added it returned 1,
# colliding with "genuinely first run" — and callers act on that difference. commands/
# pre-compact.md sets IS_FIRST_RUN=1, NEW_SEQ=1 and re-derives NORTH_STAR from $ARGUMENTS on
# the non-zero branch, so a chain with an intact ledger and one unparseable field would have
# silently RESTARTED AT SEQ 1 and overwritten the manifest, discarding the chain's history and
# its original goal. rc=2 means "this chain exists — do NOT treat it as new."

# Callers MUST inspect `.recovered_from_ledger == true` after rc=0 to decide whether
# to surface the recovery warning to the user (and optionally rebind north_star from
# $ARGUMENTS or a fresh tier-2 brief on the next /pre-compact run).
