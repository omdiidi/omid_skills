# ctx-gate-precompact-safety.sh — PreCompact hook (matcher: "auto"): last-resort safety net.
#
# Execution context: this is a Claude Code PreCompact hook script.
# It runs as a direct subprocess of Claude Code, NOT through the orchestrator Bash tool.
#
# Fires before native auto-compact would run.
# If /pre-compact never ran (no sentinel) AND ctx is below the extreme-release threshold:
#   BLOCK native auto-compact and inject reason directing /pre-compact.
# If ctx ≥ HANDOFF_AUTOCOMPACT_BYPASS_PCT (90%): RELEASE — let native compact run as a degraded
#   fallback. Handoff is lost, but this is preferable to a bricked session that can make
#   no forward progress.
#
# Trade-off: blocking native auto-compact below HANDOFF_AUTOCOMPACT_BYPASS_PCT (90%) leaves
# the session at that level. But the alternative — letting native run with no handoff
# — is exactly what the user said is unacceptable. Blocking gives the model one more
# chance to invoke /pre-compact via the next-turn UserPromptSubmit FORCE nudge.
#
# Only fires when trigger is "auto" — manual /compact (user explicit) is NEVER blocked.
# Fail-open on any error (exits 0, no block output) so a buggy gate never bricks the session.
