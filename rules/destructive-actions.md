# Destructive Actions

## Silence is not approval
An offer that got no answer is an offer that was **not accepted**. When you propose a destructive
action — overwrite, delete, move, truncate, force-push, drop — and no answer comes back, that is a
**no**, and asking twice does not convert it into a yes. Repetition is not consent; it only moves the
count of unanswered questions. Do the non-destructive part, say plainly what you did not do and what
you would need in order to do it, and leave the destructive half undone until someone actually says
yes. The asymmetry is the whole reason: waiting costs a round trip, and being wrong costs work that
no longer exists.

## Never destroy a prior version in a shared or human-owned path
`~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, a scratch directory another agent is working in — these
hold files with no version history and, often, no other copy. **Never overwrite another agent's
work.** Before writing over anything you did not create in one of these paths: write to a NEW
filename, or copy the original to `<name>.bak` first, and say which you did. The failure this
prevents already happened here — an agent found errors in a relay prompt authored by a different
window, offered twice to fix it, got no reply, and overwrote it in place with no backup; the original
was recoverable only because the acting agent still happened to hold the text in its context. That is
luck, not a procedure.

(SCOPE: paths with no undo. This is NOT a rule against ordinary in-repo edits — a tracked file under
version control has `git` as its backup, and adding `.bak` files beside it is clutter, not safety.
The line is whether a prior version still exists somewhere after you write.)

**A machine now backs the second rule, and it is a net, not a licence.** A `PreToolUse` hook
(`$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/shared-path-overwrite-guard.sh`) copies the prior contents to `<name>.bak-<UTC minute>`
before a `Write`/`Edit` lands on an existing file in those paths. It exists because a rule that lives
only in a context window enforces nothing, and this failure is both silent and able to recur — the two
conditions `verify-by-mechanism.md` sets before a rule earns a guard. It deliberately does NOT block:
it makes the destruction reversible, it does not decide whether you were right to destroy. So it
changes nothing about your obligation — still write a new filename, still say what you overwrote and
where the backup is. And it does not cover `Bash` (`rm`, `mv`, `>`), a **symlink** target (following
one copied the link's target into the shared directory as a new plaintext file, so it now skips them
outright — a symlink has no prior contents of its own to preserve), a window that has not restarted
since the hook was added, or a machine where it is disabled. Its own backups age out after 14 days.
Behave as though it is not there.
