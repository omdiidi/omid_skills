# Commit Agent

Selectively commit changes from this session, ignoring unrelated modifications.

## Step 1: Understand What Was Done

Gather context about what was implemented:
1. Check for plans in `./tmp/done-plans/` and `./tmp/ready-plans/` — if any exist, read them for file lists and feature descriptions.
2. If no plans exist, use the conversation history to understand what files were created or modified and why.
3. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and does NOT match the `type: description` commit message format, use it as additional context for what should be committed (it will be used for classification in Step 3, not as the commit message).

## Step 2: Inspect All Changes

1. Run `git status` to see all modified, added, and deleted files.
2. Run `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --cached` (staged) to see the actual changes. Treat both as a single pool of changes to classify.
3. If there are no changes at all, tell the user there is nothing to commit and stop.

## Step 3: Classify Changes

For each changed file (whether staged or unstaged), determine if it's **relevant** or **unrelated**:

**Relevant** — changes that match work done in this session:
- Files explicitly created or edited during the conversation
- Files referenced in plans (done-plans or ready-plans)
- Supporting changes (imports, types, config) that are clearly tied to the main work
- `./tmp/done-plans/` files and `./tmp/context.md` changes associated with the work

**Unrelated** — changes that don't match:
- Files not discussed or touched in the conversation
- Pre-existing modifications from before the session
- Changes from other agents or manual edits unrelated to the current task
- Unrelated `./tmp/` files (research notes, other plans)

When in doubt, **ask the user** rather than guessing.

If zero files are classified as relevant, tell the user that no changes match the current session's work and stop.

Present the classification to the user and wait for their confirmation before proceeding:

```
Relevant changes (will commit):
  - path/to/file1.ts — [brief reason]
  - path/to/file2.ts — [brief reason]

Skipped changes (not committing):
  - path/to/other.ts — [brief reason]
```

If the user wants to adjust the classification, update accordingly.

## Step 4: Stage and Verify

1. `git add <specific files>` — only the relevant files from Step 3. **Never** `git add .` or `git add -A`.
2. Review the staged diff (`git diff --cached`) for secrets or credentials:
   - API keys, tokens, passwords
   - .env files or credential files
   - Private keys or certificates
3. If secrets are found, **warn the user**, unstage the offending files, and ask how to proceed. Do not commit files containing secrets.

## Step 5: Create the Commit

1. Write a commit message:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` matches the `type: description` format (e.g., `feat: add commit skill`), use it verbatim as the commit message.
   - Otherwise, derive a message from the work context.
   - Format: `type: short description` (feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore). Under 72 characters. Imperative mood.
   - Add a body with bullet points if the commit covers multiple logical changes.
2. Create the commit.

## Step 6: Report

Present the result. Only suggest `/commit` again if there are uncommitted files remaining.

```
Committed: <short sha> <commit message>

Files included:
  - <file list>

Files left uncommitted:
  - <file list, or "none">

Next steps:
  - `/prepare-pr` — Rebase, build, and open a PR
```
