# Document

Audit existing documentation or create it from scratch. Output lives in `./docs/` with a fixed skeleton that adapts to what the project actually has.

**Focus (optional):** $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Detect current state

Batch these independent tool calls in one message:
- `Glob docs/**/*.md`, `Glob **/README.md`, `Glob **/CLAUDE.md` — find existing docs
- `Read ./CLAUDE.md` if present at repo root
- Detect stack: check for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `supabase/`, `next.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, framework markers
- Detect monorepo: `workspaces` in package.json, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `lerna.json`, `nx.json`
- Check for DB: `supabase/`, `prisma/`, `drizzle/`, `migrations/`, `*.sql`
- Check for API surface: `app/api/`, `pages/api/`, `routes/`, `src/api/`, `functions/`, edge functions
- Check for auth: middleware files, `lib/auth`, NextAuth/Clerk/Supabase-auth imports
- Check for deployment: `netlify.toml`, `render.yaml`, `vercel.json`, `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`
- Check for external integrations: `Read .env.example` if present, search code for SDK imports (stripe, supabase, openai, anthropic, netlify, etc.)

**Monorepo handling:** if detected, ask the user: "Monorepo detected. Document the root, or per-package? (root / per-package / both)" and proceed accordingly. Per-package creates `packages/<name>/docs/` per package.

## Step 2: Classify

- **No docs exist** (no `docs/` dir, no substantive README) → BOOTSTRAP mode
- **Docs exist** → AUDIT mode
- If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies an area, scope both modes to that area only

## Step 3a: BOOTSTRAP mode

Create `./docs/` with this skeleton, skipping files for areas that don't apply. If an existing file in `docs/` covers the same area under a different filename (e.g. `api.md` vs `apis.md`), reuse the existing filename rather than creating a duplicate.

```
docs/
  README.md          index, "start here" for humans and LLMs
  INDEX.json         machine-readable manifest for LLM navigation
  architecture.md    system overview, data flow, major components, auth flow
  database.md        schema, migrations, RLS (if applicable)
  backend.md         services, routes, business logic
  frontend.md        components, state, routing, build
  apis.md            internal API surface, request/response shapes
  integrations.md    external services, webhooks, env var names
  operations.md      deployment, runtime, observability, background jobs
```

Each `.md` file starts with frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: [Area]
source_files: [list of files/dirs this doc describes]
entry_points: [main exported symbols, route paths, or key identifiers]
last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

`docs/README.md` is the human index: list every doc file with a one-line summary and a "Start here if you want to..." section pointing to the right entry point for common tasks.

`docs/INDEX.json` is the LLM manifest:
```json
{
  "docs": [
    {"path": "docs/architecture.md", "title": "Architecture", "summary": "...", "source_files": [...], "entry_points": [...]}
  ]
}
```
This lets an LLM load one small file and decide what to read next.

Spawn parallel sub-agents using the Agent tool with `subagent_type: Explore` (one per applicable area) to gather source material. Each agent returns: purpose of the area, key files and their roles, data shapes, entry points, gotchas. Write each doc from the agent's findings.

For `integrations.md`: list each external service, what it's used for, which env vars it needs (names only, never values), and where in the code it's invoked.

Target 150–250 lines per doc. If an area is larger, split by subtopic (e.g. `backend/routes.md`, `backend/services.md`) and link from the parent doc and from `INDEX.json`.

## Step 3b: AUDIT mode

For each existing doc:
1. Read the doc and its `source_files` frontmatter (if present).
2. Spawn an `Explore` agent to verify: do the referenced files still exist, do the described behaviors match current code, are there new files in that area not covered.
3. Report drift per doc (green = accurate, yellow = partial drift, red = substantially wrong).
4. Update affected sections. Bump `last_verified`. Add new subsections for new behavior.

If an area has no doc but has substantial code, create the missing doc using BOOTSTRAP logic for that area only.

If `CLAUDE.md` exists, cross-reference it and flag conflicts between `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` so the user can reconcile.

## Step 4: Index refresh

Rewrite `docs/README.md` so it accurately reflects the current set of files and their summaries. Keep it short. One line per file plus a small "Start here if..." map.

Regenerate `docs/INDEX.json` from the current set of docs and their frontmatter.

## Step 5: Report

Output a compact summary:
- Mode used (BOOTSTRAP or AUDIT)
- Files created or updated (list with paths)
- Drift found and fixed (AUDIT only)
- Anything skipped and why
- Anything the user should verify manually (ambiguous behavior, inferred intent)

## Rules

- Do not touch `CLAUDE.md` unless the user asks. It is user-managed.
- Do not write credential values, only the env var names.
- Do not fabricate behavior. If something is unclear from the code, write "unclear, verify with maintainer" rather than guessing.
- Target 150–250 lines per doc. Split if longer.
- Do not clobber docs generated by other tools (TypeDoc, Sphinx, Docusaurus). If `docs/` looks tool-generated (e.g. has `_build/`, `.doctrees/`, or matching source config), ask the user before writing.
- If the project has no substantial code (empty repo, boilerplate only), stop and tell the user: "Nothing substantial to document yet."
- Write in short declarative sentences. No marketing adjectives. No em dashes.
