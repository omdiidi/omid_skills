# /mission - autonomous long-build conductor

`/mission` is a loose, judgment-driven PLAYBOOK - prose you follow, NOT an engine. It conducts
four skills - codebase-research -> `/plan`(+reviewers) -> `/implement` -> `/codex-review` - over
the durable mission-bridge, riding `/pre-compact`, looping implement<->review to honest
convergence, per part, across many compactions. DO NOT over-engineer or over-constrain: the
four-skill sequence is the SPINE, not a cage; you stay free to invoke any other skill. Most LOG lines
are a best-effort boundary checkpoint - observational, never a gate; a missed phase-line degrades resume
granularity, not work. EXCEPTION: the wake-routine control state (the `AWAIT` marker + the
`cursor-hash`/`await-state` reads, §7/§12) IS load-bearing: an `await`/bank `FAILED` → retry then §10
STOP-LOUD; a `COLLISION` → re-read + reconcile; a `corrupt` cursor/await → §10 STOP-LOUD. Never proceed
as if succeeded. Opt-in and HEAVY (per part: 4-6 plan-review rounds + a
4 Codex + 3 Claude code-review panel over 3-6 rounds) - use it ONLY for genuinely large
multi-part builds; never for a typo, a one-liner, or a single bug fix.

## CONTRACT CORE

This core is self-sufficient for a post-compaction agent; full detail continues in §1-§12 below the
marker, which a live (untruncated) invocation must read and follow.

### CONTINUATION-OWNER INVARIANT (read first - a mission turn NEVER yields naked)

A `/mission` turn MUST NOT end unless ONE holds: (a) it JUST called `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds,
prompt=SELF_CONTAINED_TICK, reason)` as its LAST such call AND it SUCCEEDED (only the
tick-lock release may follow), or (b) it is at a genuine stop (§9 contact / §12.3 stop, incl.
`AWAIT kind=human`). **A scheduled wake is the ONLY continuation owner** - a tracked
`run_in_background` job is NOT (its wake can be lost); a turn yielding with a job pending STILL
schedules a fallback heartbeat. Any other turn-end is a NAKED YIELD that freezes the mission -
NOTHING retries it (§12.5). A FAILED `ScheduleWakeup` is not (a): retry once, then STOP LOUD via
`pending-stop`. **§12.1 step 7 is the MANDATORY EXIT GATE - no path returns except through it.** A commit /
finished unit / report / peer reply is NOT a stop (§12.3), and
**announcing an action never substitutes for taking it**. The wake routine - `mkdir` tick-lock + §8
resume-read + cursor-compare + reschedule - lives in §12; every wake source (bg completion, tick,
post-compact resume) funnels through it, ONE transition.

### A. Resolve sid + root + mission file FIRST (§1)

- `sid` = the platform session UUID, STRICTLY `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` then `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`.
  Both empty -> STOP loud. NEVER guess by transcript mtime (that is how two instances collide).
- `root`: `. "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"` then
  `root=$(handoff_canonical_root)`.
- `mfile=$(mission_resolve_path "$sid" "$root")` - manifest pointer -> deterministic
  `MISSION.<sid>.md` -> empty. Empty = THIS session has no mission yet; it NEVER means "adopt the
  newest file". Non-zero rc = hard error -> STOP. Your mission is always owned by your own sid.
- Before doing mission WORK (not status/clear/stats), stamp the timing entry once:
  `mission-write.sh timing-resume <sid> <root>` (advisory). `MISSION-START` and the first
  `WORK-START` are LIB-ONLY emissions stamped at create - never log them by hand (the validator
  REFUSES them through the `log` verb).

### B. Dispatch modes (§2, §2b)

- blank / `status` -> read-only: run the §H resume read, print mode/part/phase/round/dry + the
  active PLAN directive + PENDING DECISIONS. No mutation.
- `clear [reason]` -> log `[mission] MISSION-CLEARED status=cleared reason=<slug>` with an EMPTY
  idtag (lifecycle lines ALWAYS append; a non-empty idtag would dedup-suppress a re-clear after a
  rebaseline), then `archive-close`.
- `stats` -> read-only `mission_stats_render` (machine-wide lifetime ledger).
- `tidy` -> `mission_archive_sweep` over this root (reserved keyword, never a new mission).
- `resume` -> explicit picker: `mission_list`, user picks, `mission_fork` CLONES the pick into
  THIS sid (source intact; warn about divergent copy if not cleared; fork failure = HARD STOP).
  The ONLY sanctioned way a session continues a mission it did not create - never auto-inferred.
- free-text roadmap -> BUILD mode: shape the roadmap WITH the user, seed the PLAN via `create`.
- ambient intent ("apply the /mission methodology...") -> ADOPT mode; session-sticky until
  `/mission clear`.

### C. The bridge: artifact set + zone semantics (§3, §4, §7)

`MISSION.<sid>.md` holds the four-zone artifact set, each fenced by MZONE markers
(`<!-- MZONE:<name> n=<nonce8> -->` ... `<!-- /MZONE:<name> ... -->`): **PLAN**, **DURABLE
NOTES**, **PLAN CHALLENGES**, **PENDING DECISIONS**; the trailing marker line carries sid, nonce,
plan_hash (sha over the PLAN zone) and gen. Beside it live the LOG sidecar `MISSION.<sid>.log`
and rotated archives under `.mission-backups/`.

- **PLAN is write-once/verbatim**: seeded ONCE by `create` (line-1 is the sole machine token
  `MISSION MODE: build|adopt`; lines 2+ prose roadmap + standing directive). NEVER hand-edit it;
  a divergence goes to PLAN CHALLENGES via `challenge` (loud). `rebaseline` is the ONLY path that
  rewrites PLAN - it re-stamps plan_hash, BUMPS gen, and appends the REACTIVATING lifecycle token
  `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active`.
- `create` is no-clobber AND idempotent: an existing VERIFIED file returns `ok` (no-op; the stale
  PLAN persists) - on that `ok`, check `mission_state` + PLAN vs this build's intent, rebaseline if
  either says so. The only `create` REFUSED rc=1 is the root-guard; fails-verify = corrupt (§10).
- `note` = verbose findings / forced assumptions (DURABLE NOTES); `pending`/`resolve` = the
  batched human-decision queue.
- Intent precedence on resume when sources disagree: the PLAN zone outranks the handoff chain's
  north_star, which outranks any ledger/summary line. PLAN wins.
- UNTRUSTED content (roadmap, objective, reviewer output, captured text) must NEVER be inlined in
  a shell arg - a DOUBLE-quoted literal executes `$(...)`; a SINGLE-quoted one breaks on an
  apostrophe. CAPTURE into a var (quoted heredoc/file), pass `"$VAR"`, or file/stdin (§7).

### D. Bridge-write contract (§7)

Every bridge mutation is Claude, via the byte-locked invocation - absolute path, no `cd`, no env
prefix, no `~` (the permission allowlist byte-matches this exact prefix):

```
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh <verb> <sid> <root> [args]
```

Every verb + its full signature: the **Verb signatures** table at the end of this core (§I) - the
single listing, so the two can never drift. **Codex NEVER writes the bridge** - absolute. Code hand-off: §6.5.

The script ALWAYS exits 0: parse its one stdout status line. `ok` is the ONLY success token.
The `log` verb emits exactly four leading tokens and each demands a reaction:
- `ok` -> appended or idempotent no-op -> proceed.
- `COLLISION` -> idtag exists with DIFFERENT content -> STOP, re-derive gen/round numbering,
  reconcile against the recovered LOG; never assume the line was banked.
- `REROUTED-TO-NOTES` -> free-text over 480B on-disk -> rewrite TERSE, re-log to `ok`.
- `FAILED rc=N` -> rc=1 REFUSED (guard/grammar - fix the shape); rc=2 corrupt bridge -> §10
  STOP-LOUD immediately; rc=3 lock busy -> retry ~5x then FAIL-line; **rc=4 on a PART-DONE or
  live-verify write BLOCKS retirement/advance** (do the named remediation); rc=5 wrong-gen idtag
  prefix (re-derive the gen); other rcs -> log + proceed, recurring ones feed the 5-FAIL breaker.
**`pending-stop` EXCEPTION to "other rcs -> log+proceed": ONLY `ok id=pd:<seq>-<slug>` proceeds; ANY
non-zero rc = the STOP did NOT open -> do NOT proceed/auto-advance (S1 naked-yield).**
`void-count` stdout is a bare integer; **`-1` is the ERROR SENTINEL of a refused gen-sliced read
-> STOP** (never count 0, never advance).

### E. LOG-line grammar (§7 - resume greps read back EXACTLY these shapes)

On-disk line = `<idtag>\t<entry>`. Keep round lines TERSE: the 480B reroute budget covers
idtag + TAB + entry + newline, and a rerouted line lands in DURABLE NOTES where resume cannot
grep it. Verbose findings go in a separate `note`, written BEFORE the terse round line.

- Round: `[mission] part=<N> name=<slug> phase=<research|plan|implement|review|fix> round=<K>
  dry=<D>[ findings=<COUNT>]`, idtag `m<N>-<phase>-r<K>-d<D>` (d<D> REQUIRED). `findings=` is a bare
  integer COUNT, MANDATORY on `phase=review`/`phase=fix` rounds; `dry=` is the running
  consecutive-dry count (0-2) after the round. `phase=review` = findings logged, fixes NOT yet
  applied; advance the SAME round to `phase=fix` when fixing.
- VOID: `[mission] VOID part=<N> phase=review round=<K> reason=<slug>`, idtag
  `m<N>-void-r<K>-<runid6>h<sha8|nofile>`.
- FAIL: `[mission] FAIL part=<N> phase=<P> reason=<slug> attempt=<A>`, idtag
  `m<N>-fail-<reason>-<attempt>` (attempt REQUIRED - a reason-only idtag dedup-collapses the
  5-strike tally).
- live-verify: `[mission] live-verify part=<N> round=<K> status=ok evidence=<token>` or
  `... status=n/a reason=<slug>`, idtag `m<N>-live-verify-r<K>`.
- SNAPSHOT: `[mission] SNAPSHOT part=<N> kind=converged tree=<h16> ...` - auto-stamped by the lib at
  the dry=2 round (feeds the stale-claim guard).
- Lifecycle: `[mission] PART-START part=<N> name=<slug>` (idtag `m<N>-part-start`);
  `[mission] PART-DONE part=<N> (converged)` (`m<N>-part-done`);
  `[mission] PART-RETIRED part=<N>` (`m<N>-part-retired`);
  `[mission] test-trust part=<N>=<ok|added|n/a>` (`m<N>-test-trust`);
  `[mission] criticer part=<N> findings=<K> <headline>` (`m<N>-criticer-r<round>`);
  `[mission] MISSION-CLEARED status=<achieved|could-not|cleared> reason=<slug>` (EMPTY idtag);
  `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active gen=<G> ...` (lib-written, EMPTY idtag).
- Gen scoping: gen-1 idtags stay unprefixed; gen>=2 are auto-prefixed `g<G>-` by the lib - always
  pass the bare `m<N>-...` form (a wrong prefix is REFUSED rc=5). Convergence, VOID count and the
  FAIL tally read only the CURRENT generation slice.

Example emission (the exact invocation form):

```
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] part=2 name=auth phase=review round=3 dry=1 findings=2" "m2-review-r3-d1"
```

### F. The per-part phase loop + convergence (§5, §6)

Per part: **research -> plan -> implement -> review barrier -> convergence loop**. Every fan-out
is parallel-INDEPENDENT: self-contained prompts, no reviewer sees another's output.
Never chain reviewers.

1. RESEARCH: Claude explorer subagent + Codex read-only fact pass (prompt via file/stdin, never
   inlined; check the `.status` sidecar) in parallel; reconcile; contradictions -> `pending` +
   `note`, proceed loudly on the more-evidenced branch.
2. PLAN: `skill: plan` (its built-in Codex pass IS the cross-model lane - do not add a second).
   REQUIRED before the first implement round: log
   `test-trust part=<N>=<ok|added|n/a>`; absent on resume = unresolved -> re-assess.
   Surface a one-line criticer headline if `/plan`'s Criticer Notes have findings (advisory,
   never gates).
3. IMPLEMENT: `skill: implement --no-review <explicit-per-part-plan-path>` - always the explicit
   path; `--no-review` makes /mission own the review barrier and the plan lifecycle.
4. REVIEW BARRIER (parallel, independent): implementation-reviewer subagent + `skill:
   codex-review --effort high` (raise to xhigh only for genuinely critical parts). A round is
   VALID only if EVERY reviewer verdict is present: the report file's Engine header must show
   `Codex-passes: 4/4`, parsed via the `parse-codex-header` verb on `report-final.md` (never grep
   the body). After `/codex-review` returns, materialize its final text into
   `review_output` yourself (Write a temp file, read it back); sid/root/N/K/review_output must ALL
   be non-empty before the VOID block runs (BINDING CONTRACT: §5). N<4, a dead/empty/timed-out
   reviewer, or legacy `Codex unavailable` -> round is **VOID**: log the VOID line (require `ok`
   first), run `void-count`; 3 consecutive VOIDs -> `FAIL ... reason=panel-unavailable-3x` +
   **STOP LOUD immediately** (never wait for the 5-FAIL tally). `void-count` -1 -> STOP (§10).
   A VOID is re-run fresh, never banked.
5. Round write order: verbose per-reviewer findings `note` FIRST, THEN the terse round line
   (resume keys on the round line; the reverse order strands a banked round with no findings).
   Actionable findings -> log `phase=fix` for the SAME round, fix, re-run the barrier as round
   K+1. Never re-run an idtag round you already banked.

CONVERGENCE rules: stop at **2 consecutive non-void DRY rounds** - "dry" = the independent
reviewers returned zero new actionable findings, logged verbatim.
An ACTIONABLE round **RESETS dry -> 0** (including an actionable re-run of a VOIDed round - a
dry=2 streak can never span a code change); a VOID alone never advances dry. Soft targets: plan
reviews 4-6, codex reviews 3-6. `findings=` on a round line counts BLOCKING findings ONLY (§6.0); non-blocking ones are recorded
verbatim and NEVER fixed in-part. CAP: <=6 BLOCKING-producing rounds, dry pair EXEMPT; cap hit -> PARK
the part, never a STOP (§6.1). Once dry=1 banks the window is FROZEN: no code change, no
phase=fix/implement until dry=2 + live-verify + PART-DONE land (§6.2).
Convergence is computed ONLY from `phase=review` (or VOID)
lines - never from fix/plan/implement/research lines.

### G. PART-DONE gate (§5 tail)

Immediately after the dry=2 round banks and BEFORE PART-DONE, emit the live-verify line
(UNCONDITIONAL, once per part; `status=n/a` needs a reason slug). `mission-write.sh` REFUSES
`PART-DONE` with rc=4 - BLOCKING advance - unless ALL of:
1. a FRESH, **gen-current live-verify part=<N>** exists, newer than the last actionable event;
2. the dry-count fold over this generation's review rounds is **machine-clean**;
3. the code-tree fingerprint still matches the converged SNAPSHOT (**tree moved ->
   `convergence-stale`** -> re-run review at the current tree to a fresh dry=1 -> dry=2 pair,
   then re-log PART-DONE).
Then retire the part plan (idempotent `mv` ready-plans -> done-plans; `PART-RETIRED` on success,
`FAIL ... reason=plan-mv-failed` on failure - never silently), then `PART-START part=<N+1>` and
begin that part's research.

### H. The §8 resume read (the SINGLE canonical recovery idiom)

Used by status, resume, and every post-compaction re-entry:
- `grep -F '[mission] '` over **ALL rotated archives**
  (`.mission-backups/MISSION.<sid>.log.*.gz|.txt`, oldest->newest by filename-timestamp)
  **THEN the live `MISSION.<sid>.log`**. `tail -n 40` and newest-archive-only are BANNED (both
  miss lines past rotation).
- Derive four values: `cur_part` (last PART-START|PART-DONE part=; empty -> 1); `mission_state`
  (last `MISSION-(CLEARED|REBASELINED)` line - the GLOBAL active-iff gate; transient progress
  lines NEVER gate it); `last_review` (part-scoped last `phase=review` round OR VOID - the ONLY
  input to convergence: you need `2 - dry` more dry rounds); `last_round`/`last_progress`
  (positioning only).
- Active-iff: latest lifecycle = CLEARED -> INACTIVE; latest = REBASELINED status=active ->
  ACTIVE; empty state + PLAN line-1 is a `MISSION MODE:` token -> ACTIVE.
- Decision table (apply in order; **AWAIT rows FIRST**): `AWAIT kind=human got<need` -> human STOP:
  NON-EMPTY `last_decision` = CONSUME (approve=run the idempotent action, deny=abort; never
  re-ask); EMPTY = STOP for a user; close under the lock (C6) = DECISION -> `await got=1` ->
  `resolve`. `AWAIT kind=job got<need`: tracked job pending -> collect nothing but STILL schedule a
  fallback wake (a pending job NEVER owns continuation); NO tracked job -> replay the missing lane
  (same attempt), or on timeout/FAIL start attempt A+1. `AWAIT got=need` -> reconcile + bank the
  single successor. Then:
  latest progress `PART-DONE`/`PART-RETIRED` -> part COMPLETE
  (re-attempt retirement if PART-RETIRED absent, then next part; never consult stale round
  lines); `PART-START` with no round yet -> begin at research; last round `phase=fix` -> finish
  the in-flight fix, then barrier as K+1; `phase=review findings>0` -> fix of the SAME round K;
  `phase=review findings=0` -> next fresh round K+1; latest line for K is VOID -> re-run K fresh;
  `phase=research|plan|implement` -> continue that phase, then the barrier.
- `test-trust` recovered = honored; absent = unresolved. Intent precedence: PLAN > north_star >
  ledger (§C).

### I. Hard rules + loud stops (§9, §10, §11)

- NEVER hand-edit the PLAN zone; `challenge` loudly, `rebaseline` is the only rewrite path.
- Codex NEVER writes the bridge; no 2nd writer. Code: §6.5 wrapper ONLY.
- STOP LOUD on: **5 FAILs for the same part+phase** (gen-sliced tally);
  **panel-unavailable-3x the moment it is logged**; **void-count -1**; **a corrupt/unreadable
  bridge** (any `FAILED rc=2`, or a failed `mission_verify`) - surface `.mission-backups/`.
- Blocked-on-human (autonomous runs) - SPLIT by whether the answer GATES the work: **no gate** ->
  `pending` + loud assumption, proceed. **Gates this item** -> `pending`, MOVE to work that does not
  depend on it, re-ask on return. **Gates all remaining work** -> `pending-stop` + PushNotification,
  park. Never guess past a gate; never idle behind one. Credential / destructive / external-side-effect skills require a human PENDING decision
  - never auto-run them.
- Natural close order: `timing-close` -> `MISSION-CLEARED status=achieved|could-not` (EMPTY
  idtag) -> `archive-close` LAST.

**Verb signatures (all `bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh <verb> <sid> <root> [args]`):**
`create "<seed>"` - seed PLAN once (idempotent) | `log "<entry>" "<idtag>"` | `await "<fields>"` (barrier open/close - §7/§12; NEVER via `log`) | `note "<text>"` | `challenge "<text>"` | `pending "<slug>" "<q>"` (non-blocking) | `pending-stop …` (BLOCKING: opens the human STOP + records pd, ECHOES `id=pd:<seq>-<slug>`; CAPTURE it; op=id minus `pd:`) | `resolve "<full pd:id>"` | `rebaseline "<new-plan>"` (ONLY PLAN rewrite path) | `render-banner` | `timing-resume` / `timing-contact` / `timing-close` | `archive-close`. FOUR read-only bare-token argv EXCEPTIONS (no status line): `parse-codex-header <report-file>`; `void-count <sid> <root> <part-N> <round-K>` (all 4 REQUIRED, part then round; a 2-arg call returns the `-1` STOP sentinel); `await-state <sid> <root>` (`none`|`corrupt`|`await …`); `cursor-hash <sid> <root>` (§12 change-detect). Corrupt-bridge (rc=2) remediation + full verb detail: below (SS7, SS10).

# Full operational detail (S1-S12 below use the original section numbering; cross-references like "Section 7" / "§8" refer to these sections)

## 1. Resolve sid + root + mission file — FIRST, before anything else

### 1.0 Assert the conductor's model — assert, NEVER select

The conductor is the window YOU are running in, and its model is set by the user at launch
(`claude --model`). **No file can change it and this playbook must never try.** What it CAN do is
say what it is actually running as, so the user sees the real setting instead of assuming one.

At mission start, state the model you are actually running as — ONCE, one line. The user chooses
the conductor model at launch (Opus 5.5 or Opus 4.8); either is a valid conductor, so there is no
"expected" model to warn against. Subagents are not the conductor: they follow their agent
definitions (`claude-opus-5-5` at `medium` effort unless a definition says otherwise). The conductor
is the one thing that has to remember everything across compactions, which is why it is set at
launch and never re-routed per call.

Every `mission-write.sh` call needs `<sid>` and `<root>`, and a fresh `/mission` invocation
(unlike `/post-compact-resume`) has **no Stop-hook arg supplying them**. Resolve all three ONCE,
up front, and reuse them for the whole session. Mirror exactly what `post-compact-resume.md` does
(its "Resolve the durable mission file" subsection, ~line 276).

**`sid`** = the platform session UUID, taken STRICTLY from the platform the way `/pre-compact` does —
`$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` then `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. **Never guess by transcript mtime** — an mtime
guess is exactly how two interleaved instances bind the SAME sid and collide. If BOTH are empty, **STOP**
and tell the user the platform session id is unavailable, so the mission cannot be safely bound (ask
them to retry / report); do NOT proceed:
```bash
sid="${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}}"
[ -z "$sid" ] && { echo "FATAL: no platform session id (\$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID/\$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) — refusing to guess; STOP" >&2; exit 1; }
```
(Verified 2026-05-31: a slash-command shell has `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` populated even when
`$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is empty, so this fallback always yields a sid in practice — fail-loud never fires
spuriously.)

**`root`** = `handoff_canonical_root` (worktree-invariant canonical anchor):
```bash
. "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"   # sources handoff-locate.sh
root=$(handoff_canonical_root)
```

**Mission file** — resolve STRICTLY by your own sid via the lib (manifest pointer → deterministic
`MISSION.<sid>.md` → none). This REPLACES the old mtime glob, which picked the most-recently-touched
MISSION file in the worktree-invariant shared root and so silently adopted ANOTHER instance's mission
(the 2026-05-31 near-clobber). A stranger's `MISSION.<other-sid>.md` is now structurally unreachable:
```bash
mfile=$(mission_resolve_path "$sid" "$root") \
  || { echo "FATAL: mission_resolve_path errored (bad sid/root) — STOP" >&2; exit 1; }
```
`mission_resolve_path` returns the manifest-pointer target if set and present (and in-root canonical —
basename sid == marker sid == `mission_path` for this root), else the deterministic `MISSION.<sid>.md`
if it exists, else **empty**. Empty means THIS session has no mission yet (proceed to create in §3/§4,
or report none in `status`) — it does **NOT** mean "adopt whatever's newest". A non-zero rc is a hard
error (invalid sid/root): STOP; never treat it as "no mission". The pointer is the authoritative anchor
written by `mission_create`; the deterministic path is the sid-keyed backstop; there is no mtime
backstop. **Your mission is always owned by your own `<sid>`** (see §2b — even `/mission resume` clones
the picked mission into *your* `<sid>`), so use `mfile` for all reads and `<sid>`/`<root>` for all
writes throughout — there is no separate "working sid" to track.

**Run-timing — entry resume.** Once your mission exists (created in §3/§4 or resolved above) AND you are
about to do mission WORK (i.e. build/adopt execution, NOT the read-only `status`/`clear`/`stats` verbs),
stamp the timing entry exactly once at the start of this turn:
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh timing-resume <sid> <root>
```
This re-opens a working stretch ONLY if the mission was parked on you (last anchor a CONTACT); a
mid-stretch compaction resume is a no-op, so the stretch survives any number of compactions. Advisory —
ignore its status line. `mission_create` already stamped `MISSION-START` + the first `WORK-START` at
birth, so a brand-new mission needs nothing more here.

---

## 2. Invocation dispatch

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **blank or `status`** → **STATUS** (read-only, NO mutation). Resolve the mission via
  `mission_resolve_path` (Section 1). Read the **LOG sidecar DIRECTLY** (the resume-read idiom in
  Section 8 — `grep '[mission] '` over the FULL live log PLUS **ALL** rotated archives (oldest→newest),
  **not** a fixed `tail`, **not** only the newest archive, and **not** the banner: status reads the LOG
  directly). From the recovered `mission_state` (active-iff), `last_review` (round/dry) and PLAN
  line-1, derive and print: mode (build/adopt/none), current part,
  phase, round, dry-count, the active PLAN directive, and any non-empty PENDING DECISIONS. Then stop.
  Do not mutate anything.
- **`clear [reason]`** → **CLEAR**. Log the lifecycle close and stop treating work as a mission. Record
  the reason as a slug in the ENTRY TEXT, but pass an **EMPTY idtag** so the lifecycle line ALWAYS
  appends — the lib dedups on the leading idtag, so a non-empty `mission-cleared-<slug>` idtag would
  SUPPRESS a re-clear that follows a `rebaseline` (the prior CLEARED line would still be on disk and the
  fresh clear would no-op, leaving the mission spuriously ACTIVE). Lifecycle lines must never be
  dedup-suppressed (matches the lib's rebaseline, which also always-appends):
  ```bash
  reason_slug=$(printf '%s' "<reason-or-manual>" | tr 'A-Z ' 'a-z-' | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-' | head -c 32)
  [ -z "$reason_slug" ] && reason_slug=manual
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] MISSION-CLEARED status=cleared reason=${reason_slug}" ""
  # archive LAST — file the now-cleared mission's files into .mission-archive/<sid>/ (advisory; the
  # archive-close self-guard requires the CLEARED line above to be on disk, which it now is):
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh archive-close <sid> <root>
  ```
  A bare `clear` sets `status=cleared`. `achieved` / `could-not` are set ONLY by the explicit
  lifecycle close at the natural end of a mission (Section 11) — not by this verb. Parse the returned
  status line (Section 7); confirm to the user.
- **`stats`** → **STATS** (read-only, NO mutation). Print machine-wide lifetime run-timing metrics
  across ALL missions ever run on this machine. Source the lib in a fresh block (each Bash call is a
  fresh shell) and call the read-only renderer — it reads `~/.claude/mission-metrics.jsonl` (not any
  per-mission file), so it needs no sid/root:
  ```bash
  . "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"; mission_stats_render
  ```
  Then stop. (The ledger is appended once per mission close by the timing lifecycle below.)
- **`tidy`** → **TIDY** (file away closed cases). A reserved keyword — match it here, BEFORE the free-text
  fallback below, so a bare `/mission tidy` does NOT start a new mission literally named "tidy". Archives
  EVERY already-`cleared` mission still loose in this repo's root into `<root>/.mission-archive/<sid>/`,
  leaving active missions untouched. Source the lib in a fresh block and call the sweep directly (it
  prints its own report, so it is NOT routed through `mission-write.sh`):
  ```bash
  . "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"; mission_archive_sweep "$(handoff_canonical_root)"
  ```
  Then stop. Surface the sweep's report (which sids were archived) to the user.
- **`resume`** → **RESUME PICKER** (Section 2b). List this repo's missions and let the user explicitly
  pick one to **clone into THIS session** and continue (e.g. after closing the instance that started it).
  NEVER auto-inferred — the ONLY sanctioned way a session continues a mission it did not create.
- **free-text roadmap/goal** → **EXPLICIT BUILD MODE** (Section 3 → Section 5).
- **ambient trigger in a plain user message** — e.g. "follow the /mission methodology with your
  plan", "apply the /mission template to what we're doing", recognized by **INTENT, not exact
  words** → **ADOPT MODE** (Section 4 → Section 5).

## 2b. `/mission resume` — explicit clone-into-this-session (the ONLY sanctioned continuation)

A mission is owned by the sid that created it. Resume is the deliberate exception: you pick an EXISTING
mission and **clone it into THIS session's own sid** — e.g. you closed the instance that started it and
reopened. The clone is owned by your `<sid>` like any normal mission, so EVERYTHING downstream
(`clear`, `status`, writes, `/pre-compact`, `/post-compact-resume`) uses your `<sid>` with **no special
"working sid" to track**. The pick is ALWAYS explicit, never a guess. The source is left intact.

1. **Resolve `sid`/`root`** per §1. **First check if THIS session already owns a mission**
   (`mission_resolve_path "$sid" "$root"` non-empty): if so, show its PLAN line-1 and STOP — one
   session owns one mission, and `mission_fork` refuses an existing dest (rc 3). To continue a
   *different* mission, start a fresh instance and `/mission resume` there. (`/mission clear` only marks
   your current mission closed in its log; it does NOT remove `MISSION.<sid>.md`, so it does not free
   this session to clone another.)
2. **Enumerate** this repo's missions (read-only; space-safe; sid-matched, no mtime adoption):
   ```bash
   mission_list "$root"   # TAB rows: <sid>\t<mtime_epoch>\t<active|cleared|unknown|corrupt>\t<roadmap>
   ```
   If it prints nothing, tell the user there are no missions in this repo and stop.
3. **Present a numbered list**, newest first (as emitted): `N) [<state> <relative-time>] <roadmap>
   (sid <first8>)`. Render `unknown` as `active` (a freshly-created mission with no lifecycle line yet).
   Skip or clearly flag `corrupt` rows (unreadable/mismatched marker — not cloneable). Let the user pick
   a number, or cancel.
4. **Live-fork warning.** If the picked mission's state is `active` or `unknown` (i.e. NOT `cleared`),
   **WARN explicitly** that cloning it produces a DIVERGENT COPY (both evolve independently from this
   point — there is no merge), and require an explicit second confirmation. If its mtime is ALSO recent
   (~15 min) say it looks **live in another instance right now** (stronger emphasis) — but warn even
   when idle, since mtime is a weak liveness proxy and an overnight mission can be idle yet still owned.
   (If the source instance is genuinely closed/dead, this is the intended clean continuation — no real
   divergence; the user confirms knowing that.)
5. **Clone** (on confirm). `mission_fork` copies the picked mission into your own `MISSION.<sid>.md`
   (retargeting only the marker sid; the source stays intact) and verifies the clone; then render this
   session's banner so a SessionStart before your first `/pre-compact` doesn't false-alarm:
   ```bash
   newfile=$(mission_fork "$sid" "$root" "$(mission_path "<picked_sid>" "$root")") \
     || { echo "resume: clone failed — STOP (do not start a half-made mission)" >&2; exit 1; }
   bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh render-banner "$sid" "$root"
   ```
   **`mission_fork` failure is a HARD STOP.** On success the mission is now a normal mission owned by
   your `<sid>` (rc 3 means you already own a mission — start a fresh instance to resume a different
   one). No sid-swap, no manifest rewrite, nothing else to thread.
6. **Resume the work.** Read the cloned mission IN FULL (`mission_read_zone` for each zone + the LOG via
   the §8 resume-read idiom) and continue Level-2 at the LOG's last `(part, phase, round, dry)`, writing
   with your own `<sid>`/`<root>` exactly as in §3-§5.

**Scope:** `mission_list` covers the CURRENT canonical root (this repo) only. To resume a mission from
another project, run `/mission resume` from that project's directory.

---

## 3. Level-1 — explicit build mode (interactive, WITH the user)

This first step is **collaborative, not autonomous.** Shape the multi-part roadmap together —
**lighter than a full `/plan`**: this is the *roadmap* (the parts and their sequence), not a
part-plan. Each part later runs its own full `/plan` reviewer loop in Section 5.

Then seed the immutable PLAN once. **PLAN line-1 is the sole machine token; lines 2+ are prose.**
The PLAN payload contains the (untrusted) roadmap text, so CAPTURE it into a variable via a QUOTED
`<<'EOF'` heredoc (nothing inside expands — a `$(...)`/backtick/apostrophe is inert) and pass it
DOUBLE-quoted `"$PLAN"` (§7 rule — safe against BOTH command-substitution AND quote-breakout; a
`'…'` single-quoted literal would break on a benign apostrophe):
```bash
PLAN=$(cat <<'EOF'
MISSION MODE: build
<the multi-part roadmap: parts, sequence, intended outcome>

Standing directive: route substantial work through research → /plan(+reviewers) → /implement →
/codex-review, looping to 2 honest dry rounds (independent reviewers judge dryness); soft targets
plan 4-6 / codex 3-6, cap per §6.1; /pre-compact freely interleaved; active until a
[mission] MISSION-CLEARED line appears in the LOG.
EOF
)
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh create <sid> <root> "$PLAN"
```
`create` is **no-clobber** — it will not overwrite an existing mission, and (load-bearing) it is
**idempotent**: when a `MISSION.<sid>.md` already EXISTS and VERIFIES, the lib returns `ok` and leaves
the file untouched (other callers depend on that). So an existing **stale** PLAN does **NOT** surface as
a REFUSED — it surfaces as `ok`. The ONLY `create` failure that arrives as `FAILED rc=1 (REFUSED: …)` is
the root-guard (`REFUSED: root empty or contains '..'`); the only other `rc=1` is exists-but-fails-verify
(a corrupt file — handle via the §10 STOP-LOUD path). Parse the returned status line (Section 7) and
handle by outcome — **never silent-no-op on `ok`**:
- **`FAILED rc=1 (REFUSED: root …)`** (root-guard) → a true failure; surface it, fix the root, retry.
- **`ok` and NO prior file existed** → the PLAN was freshly seeded. Confirm it with the user, then begin
  Level-2.
- **`ok` but a `MISSION.<sid>.md` ALREADY EXISTED** (a non-mission `/pre-compact`, or a previously-
  `cleared`/superseded mission, seeded the PLAN) → `create` was a no-op and the **possibly-stale** PLAN
  persists. Do **NOT** assume the seed took. **Decide whether to rebaseline** by inspecting two things
  via the Section 8 resume-read idiom: (1) the active-iff `mission_state` (the latest
  `[mission] MISSION-(CLEARED|REBASELINED)` line) and (2) the existing PLAN zone (line-1 + roadmap)
  vs. what THIS build intends. **Rebaseline if EITHER** the mission is `MISSION-CLEARED` (latest
  lifecycle line) **OR** the existing PLAN differs from this build's intended roadmap/directive. If the
  existing PLAN already matches this build's roadmap AND the mission is active, the no-op is correct —
  just confirm and continue. When you do rebaseline, handle it exactly like §4(c): **surface it to the
  user and `rebaseline`** the PLAN to this build's directive (rebaseline is the ONLY path that
  legitimately rewrites PLAN, and it appends a `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active` lifecycle
  line that REACTIVATES a previously-cleared mission per the active-iff rule in Section 8):
  ```bash
  PLAN=$(cat <<'EOF'
  MISSION MODE: build
  <the multi-part roadmap + the same standing-directive text as above>
EOF
  )
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh rebaseline <sid> <root> "$PLAN"
  ```
  (Capture into `"$PLAN"` via a quoted heredoc and pass it double-quoted — the roadmap is untrusted; a
  single-quoted literal breaks on an apostrophe, a double-quoted raw literal executes `$(...)`; §7 rule.)
  Parse that status line too (Section 7). If the user is away, log a loud `challenge` explaining the
  rebaseline and proceed.

Confirm the seeded/rebaselined PLAN with the user, then begin Level-2 at part 1 (Section 5).

---

## 4. Adopt mode (ambient, mid-session)

The user retrofits mission rigor onto in-flight work. Resolve any existing mission (Section 1), then
**three cases**:

- **(a) No mission exists** → seed one, capturing the current objective from the in-flight context:
  ```bash
  PLAN=$(cat <<'EOF'
  MISSION MODE: adopt
  <captured current objective + state>

  Standing directive: <same directive text as Section 3>
EOF
  )
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh create <sid> <root> "$PLAN"
  ```
  (Capture into `"$PLAN"` via a quoted heredoc and pass it double-quoted — the captured objective is
  untrusted; a single-quoted literal breaks on an apostrophe, a double-quoted raw literal executes
  `$(...)`; §7 rule.)
  Parse the status line (Section 7). **`create` is idempotent: if a `MISSION.<sid>.md` already existed
  and verified, it returns `ok` as a no-op and the EXISTING (possibly non-mission/stale) PLAN persists —
  the seed did NOT take.** So if `create` says `ok` but PLAN line-1 is NOT this adopt directive (re-read
  it via the §8 idiom), you were actually in case (c), not (a) — fall through to (c) and rebaseline.
- **(b) A mission exists AND PLAN line-1 IS a `MISSION MODE:` token** → a mission-mode PLAN is present,
  but a PLAN token alone does NOT mean the mission is ACTIVE: a previously `MISSION-CLEARED` mission can
  still carry its old mission-mode PLAN on disk, and per the §8 active-iff rule it stays INACTIVE until
  reactivated. So **check the active-iff `mission_state` first** (the latest
  `[mission] MISSION-(CLEARED|REBASELINED)` line via the §8 resume-read idiom — mirror the §3/§4(c)
  logic): if the latest lifecycle line is `MISSION-CLEARED` (or there is NO lifecycle line but the
  mission was cleared/closed), the mission is INACTIVE → **REBASELINE to reactivate** (rebaseline
  appends a `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active` line, which the active-iff rule treats as
  active and which overrides the stale `MISSION-CLEARED`), exactly as in case (c). Only when
  `mission_state` shows the mission is genuinely ACTIVE (latest is `MISSION-REBASELINED status=active`,
  or `mission_state` is EMPTY with a live mission-mode PLAN) do you "continue as-is" — you are already
  in mission mode; just continue.
- **(c) A mission exists BUT PLAN line-1 is NOT a `MISSION MODE:` token** (a non-mission
  `/pre-compact` seeded the PLAN, OR a previously-`cleared` mission whose lifecycle is closed) → do
  **NOT** silently no-op (`create` is no-clobber and would quietly keep the stale PLAN). Surface this
  to the user and **rebaseline** the PLAN to the mission directive — `rebaseline` is the ONLY path
  that legitimately rewrites PLAN, and it **reactivates** the mission: rebaseline now appends a
  `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active` lifecycle line, and the active-iff rule (Section 8)
  treats the LATEST lifecycle line being `MISSION-REBASELINED` as active — so a prior
  `MISSION-CLEARED` no longer suppresses. Do **not** hand-write a separate reactivation line; rely on
  rebaseline to do it:
  ```bash
  PLAN=$(cat <<'EOF'
  MISSION MODE: adopt
  <captured objective + standing directive>
EOF
  )
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh rebaseline <sid> <root> "$PLAN"
  ```
  (Capture into `"$PLAN"` via a quoted heredoc and pass it double-quoted — the captured objective is
  untrusted; a single-quoted literal breaks on an apostrophe, a double-quoted raw literal executes
  `$(...)`; §7 rule.)
  Parse the returned status line (Section 7). If the user is away, log a **loud CHALLENGE** explaining
  the rebaseline and proceed.

**Judgment threshold (don't over-constrain):** route each *unit of work worth planning* through the
per-part sequence — a real feature/change gets the full panel; a typo or one-liner does NOT. Use
judgment about what is substantial. This is the same spine-not-cage principle.

**Exit:** adopt mode is **session-sticky** — you stay in it until the user runs `/mission clear`.
Nothing else exits it. `status` always surfaces the active directive so the user knows they're in it.

---

## 5. Level-2 — the per-part sequence (an objective, not a trapped loop)

For each part, resume at the LOG's last `(part, phase, round, dry)` after any compaction (Section 8).

**Parallel-INDEPENDENT discipline — applies to every fan-out below, load-bearing.** When you spawn
subagents in parallel, each gets a **self-contained prompt**, **NONE sees another's in-flight or
finished output**, and you reconcile/merge ONLY after all have returned (**barrier-then-merge**).
Independence is the point — independent perspectives catch disjoint failure classes; chaining
reviewers so #2 reads #1's output collapses them toward one view and reintroduces correlated blind
spots. Never chain reviewers "to save work."

### Phase 1 — RESEARCH (parallel, independent, barrier-then-merge)
Spawn in parallel, blind to each other:
- a **Claude explorer subagent** (primary: architecture / scope / risk) — spawned normally; its model
  and effort come from `agents/codebase-explorer.md`, so pass NO per-call override;
- a **Codex read-only fact pass** proving deps / build & test commands / runtime. The scope-prove
  prompt carries mission-DERIVED scope (untrusted), so it must **NEVER** be inlined into a double-quoted
  command arg — a `$(...)`/backtick in the derived scope would EXECUTE in your shell before
  `codex -s read-only` ever starts (§7 injection rule). Write the prompt to a file and feed it via
  **stdin**, so no untrusted text is ever shell-evaluated:
  ```bash
  # write the scope-prove prompt to a temp file (no shell expansion of its contents), then run it through
  # the house wrapper — it always feeds stdin from the file (`- < promptfile`), inherits the config's
  # effort — pinned to `high` by the explicit CODEX_EFFORT prefix — and writes a machine-readable `.status`
  # sidecar; no untrusted text ever reaches the shell:
  CODEX_EFFORT=high bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/codex-exec.sh /tmp/mission-scope-prompt.$$ /tmp/mission-scope-out.$$ <root>
  # CHECK THE .status sidecar — codex-exec writes ok|timeout|unavailable|nonzero-N. On `unavailable`
  # (or a nonzero-N that __KIT_ABS__/docs/codex-fallback.md step 1 covers) follow that doc: a
  # codex-fallback-reviewer runs the same prompt file and its text becomes the out file (status ok).
  # On any other non-`ok` the scope pass did NOT run (timed out); do NOT treat an empty/partial
  # /tmp/mission-scope-out.$$ as "no facts found" — note the degrade and lean on the Claude fact pass:
  st=$(cat /tmp/mission-scope-out.$$.status 2>/dev/null)
  [ "$st" = "ok" ] || echo "mission: scope-prove Codex pass DEGRADED (status=${st:-missing}) — proceeding on the Claude fact pass alone; record the gap as a note"
  ```
  (If you must pass it as an arg instead, capture it into a variable via a quoted heredoc/file and pass
  it double-quoted `"$VAR"`; never inline derived/untrusted content as a single- or double-quoted literal.)
Reconcile after both return. An **unresolved factual contradiction** → `pending` (batched) + a `note`
recording the forced assumption, then proceed on the **more-evidenced branch, LOUDLY**. Otherwise
`note` the reconciled scope. Log the research round (Section 7).

### Phase 2 — PLAN (Claude-authored; cross-model INDEPENDENT review loop)
Invoke the Skill tool with `skill: plan`. Continue once it returns. `/plan` runs its own Claude
plan-reviewer subagents AND a default parallel Codex plan pass every round (via `codex-exec.sh`) —
that IS the cross-model review lane, so do NOT spawn a separate per-round Codex plan reviewer here
(one lane, not two). That built-in Codex pass attacks executability — missing commands, undefined
steps, ordering/dependency bugs, and especially **TEST GAPS**.

**TEST-TRUSTWORTHINESS is a REQUIRED finding-class here.** Convergence is theater if the repo's tests
are weak. Assess existing coverage; if weak or absent, the part-plan MUST add meaningful tests (for
THIS repo, "tests" = the harness convention — `test-*.sh` / assumption tests; for code repos:
unit/integration). Log the verdict BEFORE the first implement round — convergence cannot be reached
while test-trust is unresolved:
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] test-trust part=<N>=<ok|added|n/a>" "m<N>-test-trust"
```
**Criticer surfacing.** `/plan` runs the generative `criticer` lane and writes a `## Criticer Notes`
section into the part-plan. After `/plan` returns, if that section has findings, surface a ONE-LINE
headline into the mission LOG so it lands in the banner's recent-log tail (the full notes stay in the
plan file). Keep the headline ≤200 chars; one emit per part+round (the fixed idtag suppresses a retry):
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] criticer part=<N> findings=<K> <one-line headline>" "m<N>-criticer-r<round>"
```
Advisory only — criticer never gates; you decide whether any note changes the plan.

Parse the returned status line (Section 7). This is a **durable resume marker**: on resume, find it
via the grep-over-FULL-log idiom (Section 8 — it must survive log rotation). **Absence = unresolved**
→ re-assess test-trust before any implement round; **presence = honored** → trust the recorded verdict
and proceed. Merge/dedupe reviewer findings (overlap = confidence, divergence = signal); iterate; log
each plan round (Section 7 round-line schema).

### Phase 3 — IMPLEMENT  ∥  Phase 4 — REVIEW BARRIER (the parallelism win)
Invoke the Skill tool with `skill: implement --no-review <explicit-per-part-plan-path>` — **always
pass the EXPLICIT plan path for THIS part** (the plan `/plan` just produced in Phase 2), never a bare
`implement --no-review` that could grab a stale or wrong plan from the ready-plans dir. Continue once
it returns. Because `--no-review` makes `/mission` own the plan lifecycle (see PART-DONE below for
retiring the plan), the plan path must be unambiguous. The `--no-review` flag suppresses
`/implement`'s built-in tail implementation-reviewer so **`/mission` owns the review barrier** (no
double impl-reviewer; the barrier runs concurrently). **Claude owns integration**;
Codex assists per-chunk. Full hand-over to Codex is allowed ONLY for isolated, mechanical, well-
specified chunks, and ONLY through the guarded wrapper in §6.5 — which enforces the worktree
isolation this sentence used to only ask for. (It previously ended "with Codex run `-s read-only`",
which made the licence unexecutable: read-only cannot write a chunk.)

**BEFORE dispatching the barrier, OPEN the AWAIT marker** (Task C — the durable "work launched, not
yet all-returned" record; `A` is this round's barrier attempt, starting at 1. R4 — a lost-wake REPLAY
re-runs the missing lane on the SAME attempt A (the persisted lane bits are reused, not discarded);
`A` increments to A+1 ONLY when a lane genuinely times out / FAILs (§8, §12.1 step 4), NEVER on a bare
replay). This is what a wake sees when a background lane completes but this turn already ended:
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await <sid> <root> "part=<N> phase=review round=<K> kind=job op=review-barrier attempt=<A> need=3 got=0"
```
Then run the **REVIEW BARRIER** — both IN PARALLEL, independent, neither sees the other's output:
- the **implementation-reviewer subagent** (plan-completeness / quality) — Claude, spawned normally at
  its definition's model and effort. Pass NO per-call model here: this lane is the primary Claude
  judgment on whether the build matches the plan, and a cheaper model reviewing its own tier's work
  is how a bad build gets waved through;
- Invoke the Skill tool with `skill: codex-review --effort high`. Continue once it returns. (The
  `--effort high` arg pins its Codex passes at high → the full 4 Codex + 3 Claude cross-model panel + verify.
  High is the right floor for this convergence LOOP: it re-runs to 2-dry and finds everything across rounds,
  so no single pass needs xhigh. For a part you judge genuinely critical — auth, payments, data migrations,
  deletions / irreversible ops, prod config, untrusted-input parsing — you MAY raise that part's barrier to
  `skill: codex-review --effort xhigh` instead. Rare by design; the loop default stays `--effort high`.)

**AWAIT got-bit protocol (Task C — the join that makes a lost barrier-completion wake self-heal).** As
EACH lane returns AND its usable result is persisted to DURABLE NOTES (the impl-reviewer subagent's
findings; and the `/codex-review` output you materialize into `review_output` per the BINDING CONTRACT
below), UPDATE the AWAIT marker with that lane's got bit set — impl-reviewer sets `bit1`, codex-review
sets `bit2`:
```bash
# impl-reviewer lane writes ONLY ITS bit (bit1). got=1:
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await <sid> <root> "part=<N> phase=review round=<K> kind=job op=review-barrier attempt=<A> need=3 got=1"
# codex-review lane writes ONLY ITS bit (bit2). got=2 — NOT got=3. The reader OR-accumulates the two
# lane bits (1|2=3 = join-ready), so the ORDER of the lanes does not matter. Writing got=3 from one
# lane would falsely read ready=1 if that lane returned FIRST, banking before the other lane finished (D2):
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await <sid> <root> "part=<N> phase=review round=<K> kind=job op=review-barrier attempt=<A> need=3 got=2"
```
**Returning from `/codex-review` alone NEVER advances the round.** The round's normal `phase=review …
findings=<COUNT>` (or VOID) line is banked ONLY at the whole-barrier join (`got=need=3`, BOTH lanes'
verdicts validated and persisted). If this turn ends after opening the AWAIT (or after only one got bit
is set) with a lane still in flight, that backgrounded lane's completion is the wake; if the wake is ever
lost, the next §12 tick sees `AWAIT kind=job got<need` with NO tracked job and replays ONLY the missing
lane (§8 AWAIT rows) — so correctness does not depend on 100% wake delivery.

**Codex-unavailable (TOTAL or PARTIAL) ⇒ VOID the round (do NOT count it as dry).** The RELIABLE
machine signal is the **`Codex-passes: N/4`** token on the **`Engine:` header line INSIDE the
report FILE** `/codex-review` Step 7f persists (`report-final.md`) — the FILE-FED contract. 7f
prints `Run-id: <run-dir basename>` UNCONDITIONALLY (even when report writing fails) and
`Report-file: <path>` as its ACTUAL FINAL output line only when the file exists. Parse the file
via the `parse-codex-header` verb (never grep the whole report body — anti-spoof lives in the
verb: it reads only the FIRST full-shape `^Engine: … Codex-passes: N/4 … Verified:` line):

```bash
# ── BINDING CONTRACT (READ FIRST — this block is NOT self-sourcing) ────────────────────────
# This fence runs in a FRESH shell that does NOT inherit your conductor context, so YOU (the
# conductor) MUST bind its inputs before running it — exactly as every other write example in

#   sid=<this mission's session id>     root=<canonical root>     # both from the §2 setup

```

Belt-and-suspenders alongside the file-fed count (either also voids the round):
- the legacy total-failure marker `Codex unavailable` (all 4 failed), OR
- the legacy per-pass marker `(Codex-` … `unavailable)` / `(codex-K unavailable)` (any one of the 4
  passes unavailable).

A round counts toward the 2-dry convergence ONLY if EVERY independent reviewer's verdict is present —
ALL 4 Codex passes (`Codex-passes: 4/4`) plus the Claude reviewers (see Section 6 VOID-on-dead-reviewer).
**Codex not installed:** `/codex-review` fills each Codex lens with a Claude `codex-fallback-reviewer`
(`__KIT_ABS__/docs/codex-fallback.md`); those lenses write `.status` ok and COUNT toward `Codex-passes: 4/4`,
and the header reads `Engine: 4x Codex (claude-fallback) ...`. The round is valid, not VOID; it just
has no second-model cross-check (its verify is skipped, `Verified: N`).
If any of the above matches, this round is **VOID**: log the durable VOID marker (Section 7), re-run the
panel; do NOT bank a void round.

**MANDATORY on every round that survives the VOID check — bind the round to its report:**
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log "$sid" "$root" \
  "[mission] REVIEW-EVIDENCE part=$N round=$K codex=$passes claude=$lenses report=$rf" \
  "m$N-review-evidence-r$K"
```
`$passes` / `$lenses` / `$rf` are the values already parsed above — do NOT re-type them from memory,
and never write `4/4` or `3/3` that you did not read out of the report. `_mw_partdone_check` refuses
convergence unless BOTH folding rounds carry a `REVIEW-EVIDENCE` line reading `codex=4/4 claude=3/3`,
and the validator STATS the `report=` path, so a fabricated path is refused.

WHY THIS EXISTS: the convergence gate checks the ARITHMETIC of round lines the agent writes itself —
two adjacent `findings=0 dry=1`/`dry=2` lines. An agent that ran 3 of 9 lanes, or ran no panel at all,
writes a line indistinguishable from a full one. The Engine-header VOID above catches a reviewer that
DIED mid-review; it cannot catch a review that never ran, because there is then no report to parse.
This line is what makes "the numbers fold" and "the work was done" the same claim. Its honest limit:
nothing in a log-append bridge can force you to emit it at all — it makes a SHORT or FABRICATED panel
refuse, and it makes skipping visible.

Merge ALL findings at **ONE synthesis barrier**. Write the round checkpoint in TWO parts so it
survives the log machinery (the lib reroutes any LOG line whose FULL on-disk form — `idtag + TAB +
entry + newline`, NOT the visible entry alone — is ≥480 bytes to DURABLE NOTES, where the resume grep
won't find it; so budget the round line with a SHORT idtag + COUNT only, §7). **ORDER MATTERS — write the verbose `note`
FIRST, then the terse round line:**
1. **Persist the verbose per-reviewer findings `note` FIRST** (DURABLE NOTES), referenced by the
   round's `part/phase/round`.
2. **THEN persist the terse round checkpoint line**, with `phase=review` and a short findings COUNT
   (Section 7 round-line schema) — TERSE, never verbose findings text.

This order is deliberate: the round line is the thing resume KEYS on (§8). If a compaction lands
BETWEEN the two writes, the verbose note exists but the round line is simply ABSENT, so resume sees no
banked review round and **re-runs the round cleanly** — far better than the reverse order, which would
strand a banked `phase=review` round whose findings note was never written (no recoverable findings to
fix). Never write the terse round line before its findings note.

The `phase=review` checkpoint means "findings logged, fixes NOT yet applied"; when you begin applying
fixes, advance the SAME round to `phase=fix` (Section 7) so a compaction in the fix window resumes
unambiguously (Section 5 resume rules / Section 8). The dry-count stays auditable from the verbatim
record rather than asserted by you.

**Continuation epilogue (Task A/B — naked-yield seam).** After the barrier join banks this round line
with work still owed (findings to fix, or the next fresh review round), do NOT end the turn naked: run
the §12 continuation epilogue — schedule the self-wake as your LAST continuation-deciding call (only the
tick-lock release may follow) — UNLESS you are at one of the four §9 points-of-contact / a §12.3 stop. Schedule EVEN when a tracked `run_in_background` lane is
pending: its completion is the fast wake, the scheduled heartbeat is the backstop that self-heals a lost
one (a scheduled wake is the ONLY continuation owner — D1). A failed schedule is a LOUD error, never a silent stop.

### CONVERGENCE (implement ↔ review fix-cycle)
Loop, per round K: if findings are actionable, log the **`phase=fix`** checkpoint for the SAME round
(it marks "now applying fixes"), fix via `skill: implement --no-review <plan-path>` → re-run the
barrier (fresh, independent) as the **NEXT** round K+1 → log that round's `phase=review` checkpoint.
**Never re-run an idtag round you already banked** (Section 8 round-ambiguity decision table). See Section 6 for the
convergence rules. On a PLAN divergence → `challenge` (loud). On an open human-decision → `pending`
(batched).

**Continuation epilogue (Task A/B — naked-yield seam).** After logging the `phase=fix` checkpoint and
re-arming the next round (whether the fix runs this turn or a fresh barrier is launched), if the turn
would otherwise end with the fix/re-review still owed, run the §12 continuation epilogue (schedule the
self-wake as your LAST continuation-deciding call — only the tick-lock release may follow) UNLESS you are
at a §9 point-of-contact / stop. Schedule EVEN when a
tracked `run_in_background` lane is pending (the completion is the fast wake, the heartbeat the backstop —
D1). Never yield naked with a fix cycle mid-flight.

**Resume substates within a round (Section 7 schema; these are the WITHIN-ROUND rows of the §8
round-ambiguity decision table — they MUST match §8 verbatim, one decision, two cross-references. §8 is
the canonical TOTAL table and additionally covers completed-part state (`PART-DONE`/`PART-RETIRED`), the
fresh-part `PART-START`-with-no-round entry state (begin at `research`), and the non-review/non-fix
phases (`research`/`plan`/`implement`); consult §8 for those):**
- last round line is **`phase=review findings>0`** (ACTIONABLE — findings logged, `dry` NOT advanced)
  → resume into the FIX of the SAME round K: log `phase=fix` round=K and apply the fixes. Do **NOT**
  start a fresh review round K+1 (that would skip the fix).
- last round line is **`phase=review findings=0`** (dry-advancing — `dry` already incremented) → start
  the NEXT FRESH review round K+1 per the `2 − dry` rule.
- last round line is **`phase=fix`** (a fix was in flight at the compaction) → VERIFY/continue the
  partial fix to completion, THEN re-run the barrier as the next round K+1. Do not assume the fix
  finished; reconcile against the working tree.

Only a `phase=review findings=0` (dry-advancing) round OR a completed `phase=fix` starts round K+1; an
actionable `phase=review findings>0` round always resumes into its own fix first.

When converged (Section 6: 2 consecutive non-void dry rounds):

**FIRST emit the live-verify line (Task 4 — UNCONDITIONAL, once per part, immediately AFTER the `dry=2`
round is banked and BEFORE `PART-DONE`).** This is the ONLY position that satisfies the freshness rule:
after the `dry=2` bank, before any advance, no later actionable event exists so the live-verify is the
newest evidence. `mission-write.sh` enforces this — a `PART-DONE` without a FRESH, gen-current
`live-verify part=<N>` is REFUSED `rc=4` and BLOCKS retirement. Run the part's live leg and record the
evidence token; for a non-UI part with nothing to click, emit `status=n/a` with a mandatory reason:
```bash
# UI/effect part — run the live leg, capture the concrete effect (a filesystem path is STAT-verified;
# an od:<num> / sha:<hex> / URL is a syntax-checked RECORDED token, not a round-trip proof):
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] live-verify part=<N> round=<K> status=ok evidence=<token>" "m<N>-live-verify-r<K>"
# non-UI part — no interactable surface to drive:
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] live-verify part=<N> round=<K> status=n/a reason=<slug>" "m<N>-live-verify-r<K>"
```
`round=<K>` is the just-banked `dry=2` round; it scopes the idtag so a fresh re-verification after a
later fix mints a NEW line instead of colliding. Parse the status line (Section 7).

**Stale-claim guard (automatic — no action required).** Banking the `dry=2` round auto-stamps a
`[mission] SNAPSHOT part=<N> kind=converged tree=<h16> …` line recording the code-tree fingerprint
convergence was reached at (a deterministic hash of committed + staged + unstaged + untracked content,
excluding the mission's own scratch files). This closes the ONE gap the write-time guards structurally
cannot: a claim that was valid when written, then the tree changed under it with no new log line. THEN
log PART-DONE:
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] PART-DONE part=<N> (converged)" "m<N>-part-done"
```
Parse the status line (Section 7) — a `FAILED rc=4 (REFUSED …)` here means the part is NOT converged
(missing/stale live-verify, the dry-count fold is not machine-clean, or **the tree moved after
convergence** → `convergence-stale`): do the named remediation and re-attempt; do **NOT** advance. For
`convergence-stale`, re-run the review at the current tree (a fresh `dry=1`→`dry=2` pair re-stamps the
snapshot at the new tree), then re-log `PART-DONE`. A legacy part with no snapshot / a non-git root is
never blocked by this check. (Manual on-demand check: `bash …/mission-drift-check.sh <sid> <root>` reports
per-part `CLEAR`/`DRIFT`/`N/A` — read-only, never enforces.) Then **retire the part plan**: because `--no-review` made `/mission`
own the plan lifecycle, MOVE the per-part plan from ready-plans to done-plans after `PART-DONE` (use
the project's done-plans convention). A plan left in ready-plans is a stale plan a later part could
wrongly grab. **Check the `mv` result — do NOT proceed silently on failure** — and make it idempotent
(a resume that lands after PART-DONE but before the `mv` must be able to tell whether retirement
happened):
```bash
if [ -f "<done-plans>/<part-plan>.md" ]; then :   # already retired (idempotent — resume after PART-DONE)
elif mv "<ready-plans>/<part-plan>.md" "<done-plans>/"; then
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] PART-RETIRED part=<N>" "m<N>-part-retired"
else
  # mv FAILED — surface it loudly, do NOT silently continue; log a FAIL (Section 7) and STOP/CHALLENGE
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] FAIL part=<N> phase=retire reason=plan-mv-failed attempt=<A>" "m<N>-fail-plan-mv-failed-<A>"
fi
```
Parse each status line (Section 7). The `PART-RETIRED part=<N>` marker (idtag `m<N>-part-retired`) lets
a resume distinguish "converged AND plan retired" from "converged, retirement still pending"; on resume,
if `PART-DONE` is present but `PART-RETIRED` is absent, re-attempt the idempotent retirement before
advancing.

**Continuation epilogue (Task A/B — naked-yield seam).** `PART-DONE` banking with a later part still to
run is NOT the end of the mission — it is a mid-mission transition. If the turn would end here with
retirement or the next-part advance still owed (and this is NOT the final part's natural lifecycle close,
§11), run the §12 continuation epilogue (schedule the self-wake as your LAST continuation-deciding call —
only the tick-lock release may follow). The natural lifecycle close of the FINAL part is the one §9 point-of-contact where the loop legitimately stops.

**Advance to the next part** — log a `PART-START` lifecycle line for the new part so resume can tell a
converged part from one still in progress (Section 8 / Section 9):
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] PART-START part=<N+1> name=<slug>" "m<N+1>-part-start"
```
Parse the status line (Section 7), then begin the next part's Phase 1.

**Continuation epilogue (Task A/B — naked-yield seam).** After banking `PART-START part=<N+1>`, the next
part's research is owed. If the turn would end before that research is dispatched, run the §12
continuation epilogue (schedule the self-wake as your LAST continuation-deciding call — only the tick-lock
release may follow) UNLESS you are at a §9 point-of-contact / stop. Schedule EVEN when a tracked
`run_in_background` job is pending (D1: the completion is the fast
wake, the heartbeat the backstop).

**Push guidance (if you push a converged part's work).** Pushing is not part of the per-part loop, but
when you do surface completed work upstream, NEVER overwrite another agent's work: `git fetch` the base
first and check for divergence; on any UNEXPECTED divergence **STOP** (rebase, never force). The bridge
artifacts live at the canonical root, never inside a per-part worktree, so a push of the code worktree
never touches the mission LOG.

## 6. Convergence rules (restated crisply)

- **Soft targets:** plan reviews typically **4-6** (4 is the usual floor); codex reviews typically
  **3-6**. These are *guidance, not gates*.

#### 6.0 What counts as a finding — the severity floor (canonical definition)

> A finding is **BLOCKING** if and only if it is: wrong behaviour reaching a user or a record; data
> loss or corruption; a security or tenant-isolation breach; PHI exposure; a broken operator or
> recovery path; or a test that can pass while the thing it guards is broken. **Everything else is
> NON-BLOCKING.** Classify by which list it belongs to, **not by how confident or how large the
> finding is.**

Defined by ENUMERATION on purpose. The obvious-looking tie-break — *"if a reviewer is unsure, call it
BLOCKING"* — was tried and **abandoned**: with seven reviewer lanes that carry no severity vocabulary,
nearly everything reads as unsure, so everything becomes blocking and the exit stays exactly as
unreachable as it was before the floor existed.

**`findings=` on a `phase=review` round line counts BLOCKING findings ONLY.** That single sentence is
what makes a part closable, and it needs no new machinery: the PART-DONE fold in
`mission-write.sh` already keys on `findings=0`, so a round that produced only non-blocking findings
banks as dry. `criticer`'s own `findings=` keeps its **raw** count — the floor is scoped to the round
line and nowhere else.

**If you are mid-part and already banked rounds with RAW counts** (the pre-floor habit), your
PART-DONE will be REFUSED `convergence-not-machine-clean` — observed in a live mission the day this
shipped, and it is the guard working, not a bug. The fix is forward-only: **re-run the barrier as
round K+1 and log the blocking-only count.** Do NOT rewrite or re-log a banked round to "correct" it —
a same-idtag write with different content is a `COLLISION` by design, and a converged streak must
never be edited into existence after the fact.

**Lane assignment.** The lane that found it assigns the class. The Claude reviewer lane's prompt
requires a class. `codex-review` returns findings **unclassified** (its output shape is owned by that
skill, not by this one), so **the conductor classifies that lane by the rubric above and records in
the round note that it did so.** Where two lanes classify the same finding differently, **the highest
class wins.**

**Everything is still recorded.** Per-round, EVERY finding goes verbatim into the findings `note`
with its label — blocking and non-blocking alike. The floor changes what *gates the round*, never
what is *written down*. That note is already the crash-safe record (§7).

#### 6.1 The cap — what it actually does

- **At most 6 rounds that produce BLOCKING findings**, per part. Rounds that produce only
  non-blocking findings, and VOID rounds, do **not** count against it.
- **The `dry=1 → dry=2` pair is EXEMPT** and always runs to completion.

Both clauses are load-bearing. Counting *all* rounds against a cap of 6 makes a part whose first
clean round is round 6 permanently unclosable — the fold needs **two adjacent** clean rounds, so it
would need a round 7 the cap forbids. Counting only blocking-producing rounds, with the dry pair
exempt, removes that trap.

**Cap exhausted → PARK the part, do not STOP the mission.** A STOP-LOUD here would freeze every
remaining part over one stubborn one:

```
pending-stop  ->  PushNotification  ->  FAIL ... reason=cap-exhausted-blocking
              ->  PART-RETIRED part=N  ->  PART-START part=N+1
```

The `FAIL` note carries a **REQUIRED disposition field** for the defective code left in the tree —
`disposition=reverted` | `isolated` | `left-with-recorded-risk`. Later parts build on that tree, so
the choice must be explicit rather than implied by silence.

#### 6.2 The non-blocking ordering rule (both halves are load-bearing)

> **Non-blocking findings are NEVER fixed inside the part.** They go to the record and are reviewed at
> mission end. If a change happens anyway, it MUST be logged `phase=fix`, and that **resets `dry` to
> 0**.
>
> **Once `dry=1` banks, the window is FROZEN:** no code change and no `phase=fix`/`phase=implement`
> line until `dry=2`, the live-verify and `PART-DONE` have all landed.

The first half prevents the unclosable-part bug (fixing non-blocking findings resets the streak
forever). The second half keeps the live-verify freshness guard honest, which the severity floor
would otherwise blind. **Both are already machine-enforced** by the PART-DONE fold: any `phase=fix`
or `phase=implement` line ordered after the `dry=1` line sets `act`, and the fold refuses with
`convergence-not-machine-clean` (rc=4).

#### 6.3 Fix hygiene and proportionality

- After each `phase=fix` round, run the **affected** suites. Run the **full** suite once before any
  barrier that could reach `dry=1`. Scoped deliberately: a full DB-dependent suite after each of 27
  fix rounds is what made one overnight run worse, not safer.
- Tag each new finding `regression` (this part's fixes caused it) or `pre-existing`. **Two
  regressions traced to one fix ⇒ revert and re-approach.** Do not patch the patch.
- **Proportionality, one sentence, measured off something you already have:** when
  `git diff --stat` since `PART-START` shows test/proof lines exceeding source lines by a wide
  margin, record a one-line reason in the round note. No ratio, no per-round arithmetic.

#### 6.4 Fan-out is a mechanism, not an aspiration

"Parallel, independent" was already written down and a run serialized the panel anyway, so state the
mechanism per tool type:

- **Agent calls:** every reviewer in **ONE assistant message**, multiple `Agent` tool calls. Separate
  messages are sequential and are the bug.
- **Skill invocations:** likewise — one message, multiple calls.
- **Bash / Codex passes:** backgrounded together in one message. Note that `codex-exec.sh` has **no
  flock**, so its passes genuinely run concurrently.
- **Within a part:** independent work items dispatch concurrently. **Parts themselves stay serial.**
- **Stop at 2 consecutive DRY rounds.** "Dry" = the **independent reviewers** returned **zero new
  actionable findings**, logged verbatim — NOT you grading your own work.
- **An ACTIONABLE round RESETS `dry → 0`** (not merely "does not count"). Any round whose independent
  reviewers produced ≥1 new actionable finding breaks the consecutive-dry streak: the post-round `dry=`
  on that round line is `0`, and the NEXT round's `dry=` starts again at `0`. Only two back-to-back
  zero-actionable rounds reach `dry=2`. State the post-round `dry` on the round line accordingly
  (Section 7). **This also covers the post-VOID case:** if a re-run of a VOIDed round turns out
  ACTIONABLE (the reviewer that finally ran found ≥1 finding), `dry` RESETS to `0` too — so a `dry=2`
  streak can NEVER span a code change, whether that change came from a normal actionable round or from
  an actionable round that previously VOIDed. A VOID by itself does not advance `dry` (the round did
  not count); an actionable VOID-rerun resets it.
- **VOID-on-dead-reviewer (the single biggest false-converge risk).** A round counts toward the
  2-dry tally **ONLY if EVERY independent reviewer produced a parseable, on-topic, evidence-citing
  verdict** — that means ALL **4 Codex passes + 3 Claude reviewers** of the panel actually ran, i.e. the
  report shows **`Codex-passes: 4/4`** (see "Codex-unavailable (TOTAL or PARTIAL) ⇒ VOID" in Section 5).
  A reviewer that errors, returns empty, times out (e.g. a Codex CLI hang), or any report showing
  **`Codex-passes: N/4` with N<4** (equivalently the legacy markers **`Codex unavailable`** = all 4
  failed, or per-pass **`(Codex-N: unavailable)`** = even 1 of the 4 failed) makes the round **VOID** →
  re-run the panel; do **NOT** bank a void round as dry. (Lenses filled by the Claude
  `codex-fallback-reviewer` when Codex is not installed count as passes, not failures - see Section 5.)
  A VOID must be made DURABLE so a compaction mid-void
  doesn't resume from the last banked dry state — log the VOID marker (Section 7 lifecycle/VOID line)
  before re-running; on resume, a VOID for round K means re-run round K fresh, NOT count it.
- **Honest early-exit** is allowed: if a super-honest look says the part is genuinely light, 2 dry
  rounds may close it early. Quality is the bar; saving time when truly converged is fine.
- **Findings logged BEFORE acting** — always persist the reconciled per-reviewer findings (or an
  explicit `0` per named reviewer) into the LOG before you fix.

#### 6.5 Codex may WRITE code - through one guarded wrapper, and only through it

The old rule bundled two different things into "Codex is ALWAYS read-only". Split them:

- **Codex NEVER writes the mission bridge.** Absolute, unchanged, non-negotiable. A second bridge
  writer is the one thing the whole artifact set cannot survive.
- **Codex MAY implement an isolated, mechanical, well-specified chunk.** New. This half was already
  half-written into this playbook ("full hand-over to Codex is allowed ONLY for isolated, mechanical,
  well-specified chunks") and then made **unexecutable** by pinning `-s read-only` on the same line.
  A licence that cannot execute is worse than no licence: it reads as capability that is not there.

**The ONLY sanctioned path is `CODEX_EFFORT=high bash scripts/codex-build-chunk.sh <promptfile> <outfile> <worktree>`.**
Never hand-roll `codex exec -s workspace-write`; every property below is enforced by that script and
by nothing else, and this session's own lesson is that a rule with no machine is not a rule.

**Pass `CODEX_EFFORT` explicitly, exactly as the review lanes do.** The variable was set NOWHERE in
this repo until 2026-08-17, so this wrapper's effort branch was dead code and every mechanical chunk
silently ran at whatever `~/.codex/config.toml` happened to say. `high` is the floor for a lane that
WRITES CODE; raise it per chunk if the work warrants, never lower it.

**It REFUSES unless the target is a LINKED git worktree** (`git worktree add`), and this is the
load-bearing safety property rather than tidiness. `-s workspace-write` makes the `-C` directory
writable. In a MAIN working tree `.git/` sits INSIDE that directory, and the bridge artifacts
(`MISSION.<sid>.md`, `.mission-backups/`) sit at the canonical root beside it - so pointing a writable
Codex at a main tree hands it both. In a LINKED worktree the real gitdir is
`<canonical-root>/.git/worktrees/<name>`, OUTSIDE the writable root, so the **sandbox boundary**
enforces the absolute half instead of a promise in a prompt.

Also enforced, each one a refusal with its own status token:

| Check | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| toplevel == the passed dir | a subdir leaves the rest of the tree writable and unaudited |
| registered in `git worktree list` | a hand-made lookalike directory is not a worktree |
| worktree CLEAN before the run | a dirty start makes the before/after diff a lie in both directions |
| HEAD, branch ref and index unchanged after | Codex must EDIT FILES ONLY; "don't run git" is instructed in the prompt AND verified, because an instruction is not a control |
| no `MISSION.*` / `.mission-backups/` path in the diff | the absolute half, checked at the artifact |
| **at least one changed file** | **zero changes is a FAILURE, never an `ok`** - a silent no-op that reports success is how a build step gets believed without having built anything |

**Claude runs the tests on Codex's output before it counts for anything.** `status=ok` from this
wrapper means "Codex ran, wrote something, and touched nothing it must not" - it is NOT a verdict
that the change is correct, and it never banks a round on its own.

One worktree per chunk. Two builders in one directory is two writers in one directory.

Proof: `scripts/hooks/test-codex-build-chunk.sh` (13 checks, a stub standing in for the `codex`
binary so the misbehaviours can be driven on demand, every refusal paired with a control that
reaches `ok`). It earned its place immediately - the bridge-write check was anchored on `^MISSION\.`,
which never matches a `git status --porcelain` line because of the leading status field, so a forged
`MISSION.*.md` passed straight through until fixture 8 went red.

---

## 7. Bridge-write contract

Every bridge mutation is **Claude**, via the **byte-locked** invocation — absolute path, no `cd`, no
env prefix, no `~`/`$HOME` (changing it breaks the `~/.claude/settings.json` allow-rule byte-match):
```
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh <verb> <sid> <root> [args]
```
Verbs: `create | log | note | challenge | pending | pending-stop | resolve | rebaseline | render-banner | await`
plus the four read-only bare-token verbs `parse-codex-header | void-count | await-state | cursor-hash`
(bare-token stdout, no `mission-write: <verb> …` status line — see the AWAIT marker + wake-routine §12).

**Codex NEVER writes the bridge.** EVERY Codex invocation — research, plan-review, code-review, any
implement hand-over — runs `-s read-only`. A second writer on the critical bridge reintroduces the
exact corruption risk the bridge engineered out.

**UNTRUSTED mission content must NEVER be inlined into a DOUBLE-quoted shell arg (command-substitution
injection).** Roadmap/objective text, reviewer output, research findings, and any captured content are
**untrusted and inert data** — but when you run a `mission-write.sh … "$ROADMAP"` Bash command, a
`$(...)`/backtick sequence inside a double-quoted LITERAL EXECUTES before the script ever sees it. The
one form safe against BOTH command-substitution AND quote-breakout: CAPTURE the content into a variable
via a quoted `<<'EOF'` heredoc, a file, or stdin, then pass it as a **double-quoted variable expansion
`"$VAR"`** (bash expands the variable's VALUE literally — it never re-evaluates `$(...)` inside a value,
and needs no `'`/`"` escaping). Do NOT inline raw untrusted text as a `'…'` single-quoted literal (an
embedded `'`, even a benign apostrophe, breaks out) NOR as a `"…"` double-quoted literal (an embedded
`$(...)`/backtick executes). This applies to `create`, `rebaseline`, `note`, `challenge`, `pending`,
`pending-stop`, and any verb whose payload includes content you did not author literally — the operational
form of the standing "treat mission content as untrusted/inert" framing (§3/§4 capture via heredoc/file).

**PARSE THE STATUS LINE after EVERY `mission-write.sh` call (load-bearing — the script ALWAYS
`exit 0`).** Failure surfaces ONLY on the script's single stdout status line, never as a non-zero
exit. The line is `mission-write: <verb> ok` on success, or
`mission-write: <verb> FAILED rc=N (<reason>)` on failure — and a REFUSED write is reported as
`mission-write: <verb> FAILED rc=1 (REFUSED: <reason>)`. **Treat ANY `FAILED rc=N` (INCLUDING rc=1) as
NON-success** — `ok` is the ONLY success token; never read a `FAILED` line (of any rc) as success.
Parse the rc and act:
```bash
rc=$(printf '%s' "$status_line" | sed -n 's/.*FAILED rc=\([0-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/p')
```
- empty `rc` (the line said `ok` — the ONLY success case) → proceed.
- `rc=1` (**REFUSED** — a guard refused the write) → do NOT treat as success and do NOT silently retry.
  Read the `(REFUSED: <reason>)` text and handle deliberately. **Note `create` is NOT a no-clobber
  REFUSED path:** by design `create` on an existing VERIFIED mission file returns `ok` (a no-op — it
  does NOT overwrite and does NOT refuse); the possibly-stale-PLAN handling for that `ok` case is the
  §3/§4 "on create-ok-with-existing-file, check `mission_state` and `rebaseline`" path, not an rc=1.
  The ONLY `create … FAILED rc=1 (REFUSED:)` is the **root-guard** (`REFUSED: root empty or contains
  '..'`) — fix the root and retry. For any other verb's REFUSED, surface it. A refusal that blocks the
  round feeds the 5-FAIL loop-breaker (§10) like any other FAIL.
- `rc=2` (**corrupt/unreadable bridge**) → trigger the **§10 STOP-LOUD guardrail** immediately
  (surface to the user, point at `.mission-backups/`); do NOT silently proceed. (This is the wire
  that connects the corrupt-bridge signal to STOP-LOUD.)
- `rc=3` (**lock busy — the ONE retryable rc**) → retry the SAME call a few times (e.g. up to 5, brief
  pause between); if still `rc=3`, log a `FAIL …reason=lock-busy` line (it routes through a DIFFERENT lock
  attempt) or proceed and note it, per the away policy (§9). **Only `rc=3` is retryable** — never blind-retry
  any other non-zero rc.
- **`pending-stop` is the BLOCKING mandatory-stop opener: its ONLY proceed-able outcome is `rc=0` with an
  echoed `id=pd:<seq>-<slug>`. EVERY non-zero rc means the STOP did NOT open — do NOT proceed, do NOT
  auto-advance; STOP-LOUD / surface to the user. The generic "any other non-zero rc → log + proceed" rule
  below NEVER applies to `pending-stop` (proceeding after a stop that never opened is the exact naked-yield
  this contract forbids).** The full fail-closed enumeration (R8r3 + R8r4-S1 — none is a retry except the
  one `rc=3`, and none is a proceed): `rc=1` bad args / refused (fix + re-issue); `rc=2` corrupt bridge
  (§10 surface); `rc=3` lock busy (the ONE retryable — retry the SAME call; if still busy, STOP-LOUD, do
  NOT proceed); `rc=4` backup failed; `rc=5` mktemp failed; `rc=6` self-check / rename failed (originals
  intact); `rc=7` sequence-exhausted (no barrier opened); `rc=8` the assembled AWAIT line ≥480B (no barrier
  opened); `rc=9` the human AWAIT did not land cleanly (no pd line, no echo); `rc=10` mission is CLEARED (a
  STOP below MISSION-CLEARED is permanently hidden — the mission is done; do not re-open); `rc=11` lifecycle
  unreadable (§10 corrupt-bridge surface, do not retry until the log/archive is readable); `rc=12` a
  DIFFERENT open human STOP is already live (resolve/deny it FIRST, then re-open); `rc=13` the same op is
  live with a DIFFERENT question (resolve/deny it FIRST — a changed question is a new decision); `rc=14` an
  ORPHAN barrier (its pd line was lost, or it already carries a durable DECISION) — safe-ABORT deny it
  (write `outcome=deny`, close the barrier, do NOT proceed; a still-needed decision opens a FRESH
  pending-stop under a DIFFERENT slug), never re-open. Each is a deliberate, agent-handled do-not-proceed outcome.
- any other non-zero rc (4/5/6/7/127) → log it + proceed; if it recurs for the same part+phase it
  feeds the 5-FAIL loop-breaker (§10). **EXCEPTION: this proceed rule does NOT apply to `pending-stop`
  (see the fail-closed block just above) — for the blocking opener, every non-zero rc is do-not-proceed.**

**EXACT-TOKEN status contract for the `log` verb (Task 4 — REPLACES the old "empty rc ⇒ ok" rule
for `log`/`note`/`challenge`/`pending`).** `mission-write.sh log` now emits one of exactly four
tokens after `mission-write: log ` — match the LEADING token and react MANDATORILY:
- **`ok`** → the write appended (or was an idempotent no-op) → proceed. The ONLY success token.
- **`COLLISION`** (`mission-write: log COLLISION (…)`) → the idtag exists with DIFFERENT content →
  **STOP**, re-derive the gen/round numbering, and **never assume the line was banked** (a banked
  round you think you wrote may not exist; a fresh line you meant to write did not land). Do NOT retry
  blindly — reconcile against the recovered LOG first.
- **`REROUTED-TO-NOTES`** (`mission-write: log REROUTED-TO-NOTES (…)`) → a free-text entry exceeded
  480B and went to DURABLE NOTES → **rewrite it TERSE and re-log until you get `ok`** (a machine
  shape that is too long is REFUSED `line-too-long` instead — see the length rule below).
- **`FAILED rc=N (…)`** → a REFUSED/failed write. `rc=4` on a **PART-DONE or a live-verify** write
  **BLOCKS retirement/advance** (the explicit carve-out from the generic rc-4 "log + proceed" policy):
  the part is NOT converged — read the `(REFUSED …)` slug (`PART-DONE without live-verify` /
  `live-verify-stale` / `convergence-not-machine-clean` / `convergence-stale` / `gen-boundary-mismatch`),
  do the named remediation (run the live leg, re-run the panel/fixes, re-review at the current tree,
  repair the boundary), and re-attempt. `rc=5`
  is a wrong-gen idtag prefix REFUSE (re-derive the gen). `rc=1 (REFUSED …)` is a grammar/control-char
  refusal — fix the shape.
- **`void-count` / `parse-codex-header` / `await-state` / `cursor-hash`** are the FOUR read-only verbs
  that DO NOT emit this status line — their stdout is a bare machine token (`void-count`: `N` / `-1`;
  `parse-codex-header`: `N/4` / empty; `await-state`: `none` / `corrupt` / `await …`; `cursor-hash`: a
  64-hex digest / `corrupt`). A `void-count` of
  **`-1`** is the ERROR SENTINEL of a refused gen-sliced read: **STOP** (do not treat as count 0, do
  not advance) and surface the corrupt/boundary condition (§10) until the write-path self-heal (or the
  user) repairs it.

**LOG schema — the SINGLE canonical definition; every resume rule (§5/§8/§9) reads lines
back in EXACTLY these shapes.** These are `log`-verb entries with a structured `[mission]` payload —
not new verbs; the real on-disk line is `<idtag>\t<entry>`; resume matches `[mission]` ANYWHERE on the
line, not at column 0.

- **Round line** (one per part/phase/round, advanced by substate — keep it TERSE so the lib does NOT
  reroute it to DURABLE NOTES, where resume can't grep it). **The 480B reroute budget is measured by
  the lib over the FULL on-disk line — `idtag + TAB + entry + newline` — NOT the visible entry text
  alone.** So budget conservatively: use a SHORT idtag and put only the integer `findings=<COUNT>` on
  the line (never finding text); the verbose findings live in a separate `note` (§5 synthesis barrier).
  - entry: `[mission] part=<N> name=<slug> phase=<research|plan|implement|review|fix> round=<K> dry=<D>[ findings=<COUNT>]`
  - `findings=<COUNT>` is OPTIONAL in the grammar (the validator row is `( findings=C)?`) but is
    MANDATORY on `phase=review` / `phase=fix` rounds — the PART-DONE dry-count machine fold reads it,
    so a review round without it cannot bank toward convergence. It is a SHORT integer count ONLY
    (e.g. `findings=2`) — NEVER verbose finding text.
    Verbose per-reviewer findings go in a SEPARATE `note` (DURABLE NOTES), referenced by `part/phase/
    round` (Section 5 synthesis barrier). **It has a READ use, not just an audit use:** on a
    `phase=review` resume it disambiguates the substate (§5/§8 decision table) — `findings=0` ⇒
    dry-advancing round (start the next fresh review round); `findings>0` ⇒ ACTIONABLE (resume into the
    `phase=fix` of the SAME round before any new review). Every written shape has this matching read.
  - `phase=review` = "findings logged, fixes NOT yet applied"; advance the SAME round to `phase=fix`
    when you begin applying fixes (CRITICAL #2 substate; resume rules in Section 5).
  - idtag: `m<N>-<phase>-r<K>-d<D>` — the **`d<D>` is REQUIRED** (encodes the dry-count so an advanced
    dry-state is a NEW line, not an idempotent no-op); `phase` is part of the idtag so the `review`
    and `fix` substates of the SAME round are DISTINCT lines. `dry=<D>` is the **running consecutive-
    dry count (0, 1, 2)** after that round; a resume agent reads the last review-round line and needs
    `2 − D` more dry rounds.
- **FAIL line** (durable failure tally, reconstructable across compactions — feeds the §10 5-FAIL
  loop-breaker):
  - entry: `[mission] FAIL part=<N> phase=<P> reason=<slug> attempt=<A>`
  - idtag: `m<N>-fail-<reason>-<attempt>` — the **`<attempt>` is REQUIRED**: the lib dedups log lines
    on the LEADING idtag, so a reason-only idtag would collapse 5 same-reason FAILs into ONE line and
    the 5-strike guard could NEVER fire. An attempt-scoped idtag makes each FAIL a DISTINCT line.
    Increment `<attempt>` per emission within the same part+phase+reason.
  - **Events that MUST emit a FAIL line:** a failed bridge write (a `FAILED rc=N` status line per the
    parse rule above, other than a transient lock-busy that succeeds on retry); a VOID reviewer
    (reviewer errored/empty/timeout, or "Codex unavailable"); a Codex hang/timeout; lock-busy still
    failing after retries (`reason=lock-busy`); a repeated tool failure that blocks the round.
- **VOID line** (durable, so a compaction mid-void does not resume from the last banked dry state):
  - entry: `[mission] VOID part=<N> phase=review round=<K> reason=<reviewer-dead|codex-passes-N4|...>`
    (the §5 reason builder is `printf 'codex-passes-%s' "$passes" | tr -cd 'a-z0-9.-'` — the `/` in
    `N/4` is STRIPPED, so a 3/4 panel yields `reason=codex-passes-34`, NOT `codex-passes-3.4`)
  - idtag: `m<N>-void-r<K>-<runid6>h<sha8|nofile>` (run-id + report-hash identity, per the Section 5
    block: replaying the SAME run+report dedups quietly; a NEW panel attempt mints a distinct line
    even with identical report bytes; a missing report uses `nofile` and still counts) — on resume,
    a VOID for round K means re-run round K FRESH, never count it.
- **Lifecycle lines:**
  - `[mission] PART-START part=<N> name=<slug>` idtag `m<N>-part-start` (logged when advancing to a
    new part; resume uses it to skip a converged part — Section 8/9).
  - `[mission] PART-DONE part=<N> (converged)` idtag `m<N>-part-done`.
  - `[mission] PART-RETIRED part=<N>` idtag `m<N>-part-retired` (the per-part plan was moved
    ready-plans→done-plans; resume reads it to tell "converged + retired" from "converged, retirement
    pending" — Section 5 retirement block; idempotent re-attempt if PART-DONE present but this absent).
  - `[mission] test-trust part=<N>=<ok|added|n/a>` idtag `m<N>-test-trust` (before the first implement
    round; durable resume marker — Section 5).
  - `[mission] MISSION-CLEARED status=<achieved|could-not|cleared> reason=<slug>` — pass an **EMPTY
    idtag** (lifecycle lines ALWAYS append; a `mission-cleared-<slug>` idtag would dedup-suppress a
    re-clear after a rebaseline and leave the mission spuriously active — §2/§11).
  - `[mission] MISSION-REBASELINED status=active (…)` — written by the `rebaseline` verb itself (the
    lib appends it, also always-append, no dedup); a REACTIVATING lifecycle token (Section 8 active-iff).
- **AWAIT line** (the ONE durable "work launched, not yet all-returned" marker — written ONLY via the
  dedicated `await` verb, which routes through `mission_await_append` → `mission_log_append` and BYPASSES
  the `log`-verb validator; read back via the `await-state` bare-token verb, never grepped by hand):
  - entry: `[mission] AWAIT part=<N> phase=<P> round=<K> kind=<job|human> op=<slug> attempt=<A> need=<mask> got=<mask>`
  - idtag: `m<N>-await-<op>-r<K>-a<A>-g<GOT>` (generation-prefixed automatically). `started_at` is
    auto-filled by the lib (barrier-stable). `need`/`got` are bitmasks; a barrier`s IDENTITY is
    (part,round,attempt,KIND,OP) — OP separates two distinct human decisions (each pd's unique
    `<seq>-<slug>`) while both review lanes share `op=review-barrier` so they still join. For the review barrier: `need=3`, `bit1` = impl-reviewer, `bit2` =
    codex-review. **EACH LANE WRITES ONLY ITS OWN BIT** (impl `got=1`, codex `got=2`); the `await-state`
    reader OR-accumulates them (1|2=3), so lane ORDER is irrelevant. Persist each lane`s usable result to
    DURABLE NOTES *before* setting its bit. `(got&need)==need` = join-ready (`ready=1`); the barrier stays
    OUTSTANDING until a later `phase=review`/VOID/PART-DONE line SUPERSEDES it (that bank IS the join). A
    human barrier is `need=1`, closed by its own `got=1` (no separate bank).
    Write form (fields reassembled in canonical order by the lib):
    ```bash
    bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await <sid> <root> "part=<N> phase=review round=<K> kind=job op=review-barrier attempt=<A> need=3 got=<this-lane-bit>"
    ```
    Read form — bare `none` | `corrupt` | `await kind=… op=… part=<N> round=<K> attempt=<A> phase=<P> need=<M> got=<G> ready=<0|1> started_at=<E>` (`corrupt` = a refused/failed read → §10 STOP-LOUD):
    ```bash
    bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await-state <sid> <root>
    ```
  The `await-state` + `cursor-hash` verbs are the wake routine's inputs (§12): `cursor-hash` returns a
  bare 64-hex rotation-invariant digest of the current-gen `[mission]` state stream (changes on ANY
  append), or `corrupt` on a failed read. It is the wake routine`s in-turn CONSISTENCY check — NOT the
  dedup for queued wakes (the tick-lock + read-current-state is that; §12 intro). Two wakes advancing
  exactly once is the LAYERED guard, not the cursor alone.
- **DECISION line** (the durable human-decision OUTCOME — the close-ordering keystone; written via the
  `log` verb, NOT a new verb):
  - entry: `[mission] DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=<approve|deny>` — `op` is the pd's UNIQUE
    `<seq>-<slug>` (the echoed `pd:` id with the `pd:` prefix removed), matching the human barrier's `op`.
  - idtag: `pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>` (gen-prefixed automatically; the `pd-` decision namespace, distinct
    from the `m<part>-` round namespace and from the `pd:<seq>-<slug>` PENDING-DECISION line id). ONE
    DECISION per op — a re-log of the SAME op+outcome is an idempotent no-op; the validator pins the idtag
    to `(g<G>-)?pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>` and checks the idtag's `op` equals the entry's `op`.
  - **M5 — the DECISION is IMMUTABLE once recorded.** The idtag `pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>` deliberately
    OMITS the outcome, so a correction attempt (an approve after a deny, or vice-versa, for the same op)
    re-uses the SAME idtag with DIFFERENT content and surfaces a LOUD `COLLISION` — never a silent flip. To
    change a recorded decision you open a FRESH `pending-stop` (a new seq); you cannot overwrite the old one.
  - **Close ordering (lib-ENFORCED):** the `await` verb REFUSES a human `got=1` close unless a same-op
    DECISION line — double-anchored (idtag `pd-<seq>-decision-` column + a body fully matching
    `outcome=(approve|deny)$`, so a torn append never counts) — exists AND appears AFTER the barrier's
    `got=0` opener in the active-gen stream, so the outcome is ALWAYS durable-and-current BEFORE the barrier
    reads resolved (a DECISION preplanted before the opener cannot authorize the close). **C9 — the READER
    (`await-state`, the verdict the wake consumes) ALSO enforces DECISION-first: a human barrier reads
    resolved ONLY IF its got meets need AND a matching post-opener DECISION exists, so a forged `got=1`
    without a DECISION stays LIVE.** The consume is DECISION -> gated action -> `await … got=1` -> `resolve`,
    ALL on the SAME wake (C2 — never close then defer the action; §8 D3 row, §12.1/§12.3).
    Write it with the ACTUAL outcome:
    ```bash
    bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=<approve|deny>" "pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>"
    ```

Example round line:
```bash
bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh log <sid> <root> "[mission] part=2 name=auth phase=review round=3 dry=1 findings=2" "m2-review-r3-d1"
```

Other zones: `note` = forced research assumptions + verbose round findings (DURABLE NOTES);
`challenge` = PLAN divergence (loud; never silently edit PLAN); `pending <slug> "<q>"` = the batched
human-decision queue (**NON-BLOCKING** — an away-policy question the run proceeds past) — the verb MINTS
a monotonic `pd:<seq>-<slug>` line (`- [pd:<seq>-<slug>] <q>`; seq is machine-assigned + never reused,
e.g. `pd:1-approve`) and ECHOES the id.
**`pending-stop <slug> <part> <round> <attempt> <phase> <q>` = the BLOCKING mandatory-stop opener**: it
ATOMICALLY opens the human `AWAIT kind=human got=0` STOP barrier AND mints the pd in ONE call (no
separate `await` open — do NOT hand-open a second barrier), then ECHOES `id=pd:<seq>-<slug>` on stdout.
CAPTURE that id; the barrier's `op` field is that id with the `pd:` prefix removed (`<seq>-<slug>`), and
you reuse the FULL id for the eventual `resolve`. Choose by whether the run must PARK: `pending` for an
away-policy question it proceeds past; `pending-stop` for a decision it must stop on (credential /
destructive / external-side-effect — §9/§10/§12.3).
`resolve <full pd-id>` drains a pending — it accepts BOTH the echoed `pd:<seq>-<slug>` and the bare
`<seq>-<slug>` form (the leading `pd:` is stripped); `rebaseline` is the ONLY path that rewrites PLAN.

**Per-shape grammar (Task 4 — `mission-write.sh log` VALIDATES every shape; the validator in the
script is the authoritative source, this table is its documentation).** A malformed shape or an
unknown `[mission]` leading token is REFUSED (`rc=1 REFUSED …`) so the malformed-shape hole is closed;
the idtag's `part`/`round`/`phase` must equal the entry's where both carry them:

| shape (leading token after `[mission] `) | entry grammar | idtag grammar |
|---|---|---|
| round (`part=`) | `part=N name=<slug> phase=(research\|plan\|implement\|review\|fix) round=K dry=[0-2]( findings=C)?` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-<phase>-r<K>-d<D>` |
| `VOID` | `VOID part=N phase=review round=K reason=<slug>` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-void-r<K>-<runid6>h(<sha8>\|nofile)` |
| `FAIL` | `FAIL part=N phase=<p> reason=<slug> attempt=A` (phase incl. `retire`) | `[g<G>-]m<N>-fail-<reason>-<A>` or `[g<G>-]m<N>-fail-panel3x-r<K>` |
| `live-verify` | `live-verify part=N round=K status=(ok evidence=<tok>\|n/a reason=<slug>)` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-live-verify-r<K>` (K == entry round — a post-fix re-verify at a new round NEVER collides) |
| `PART-START` | `PART-START part=N name=<slug>` (name REQUIRED) | `[g<G>-]m<N>-part-start` |
| `PART-DONE` | `PART-DONE part=N (converged)` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-part-done` |
| `PART-RETIRED` | `PART-RETIRED part=N` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-part-retired` |
| `test-trust` | `test-trust part=N=(ok\|added\|n/a)` (legacy glued form) | `[g<G>-]m<N>-test-trust` |
| `criticer` | `criticer part=N findings=C <bounded headline>` | `[g<G>-]m<N>-criticer-r<K>` |
| `MISSION-CLEARED` | `MISSION-CLEARED status=(achieved\|could-not\|cleared) reason=<slug>` | EMPTY (always-append) |
| `MISSION-REBASELINED` | `MISSION-REBASELINED status=active gen=<G> …` (lib-written; `gen=` is the boundary↔marker cross-check anchor) | EMPTY |
| `AWAIT` | `AWAIT part=N phase=<p> round=K kind=(job\|human) op=<slug> attempt=A need=<mask> got=<mask>` (written via the `await` verb, not `log`) | `[g<G>-]m<N>-await-<op>-r<K>-a<A>-g<GOT>` |
| `DECISION` | `DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=(approve\|deny)` (the durable human-decision outcome; a human `got=1` close is REFUSED by the `await` verb until this exists — idtag `op` must equal entry `op`) | `[g<G>-]pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>` |

**`MISSION-START` / `WORK-START` are LIB-ONLY emissions** — mission_create + the timing verbs append
them via the lib directly; they are **NEVER routed through the `log` verb** (the validator REFUSES an
external `log … "[mission] MISSION-START …"` as an unknown shape). Do not log them by hand.

**Generation-scoped idtags (Task 4).** The marker carries `gen=` (minted `1` at create, BUMPED at
rebaseline — the generation slice boundary). idtags are gen-scoped: **gen-1 idtags stay byte-identical
(unprefixed)**; a **gen≥2** idtag is auto-prefixed `g<G>-…` by the lib (you pass the bare `m<N>-…`
idtag — do NOT prefix it yourself; a WRONG `g<X>-` prefix is REFUSED `rc=5`). EMPTY idtags are exempt.
Dedup is archive-inclusive within the active generation, and the PART-DONE precondition / VOID count /
FAIL tally read only the CURRENT generation (the gen-sliced stream, after the latest gen-matching
`MISSION-REBASELINED` boundary) — so a prior generation's evidence never satisfies this generation's
convergence.

## 8. /pre-compact interleaving + resume rule

Invoke `/pre-compact` at natural seams or whenever context warrants — freely. Invoke the Skill tool
with `skill: pre-compact`. Continue once it returns.

**Resume-read idiom (the SINGLE canonical way to recover state from the LOG — used by §2 status, §5,
§9).** Do **NOT** `tail -n 40` the live log: with >40 trailing lines, or after a rotation,
`tail` MISSES the last round/lifecycle line. Do **NOT** read only the newest archive either:
`_mission_log_rotate` archives the OLDEST half on EACH fire, so after ≥2 rotations a durable line
(MISSION-CLEARED, PART-DONE, test-trust, a FAIL tally line) can sit in an OLDER archive — reading just
`ls -t … | head -1` would MISS it → false reactivation / repeated work / 5-FAIL under-count. Instead
`grep '[mission] '` over **ALL archives concatenated oldest→newest THEN the live log**, so no rotated
line is ever outside the read window:
```bash
live_log="$root/MISSION.$sid.log"
# Concatenate ALL archives in FILENAME-timestamp (chronological) order, THEN the live log.
# SET-e SAFE on ZERO archives: a fresh mission has NO archives, so an unmatched glob would expand
# to the literal pattern and an `ls <literal>` would exit nonzero — under `set -e -o pipefail` that
# would ABORT the whole pipeline BEFORE `cat "$live_log"`, losing all live state. So iterate the
# globs with a `for` + `[ -e ] || continue` guard: an unmatched glob yields its literal pattern,
# `[ -e ]` is false for the literal, we `continue` — NO failing command ever runs on no-match, and
# the live log is ALWAYS read below regardless of archive count.
# SPACE-SAFE: the canonical root can contain spaces (e.g. ".../untitled folder/skills"), so every
# path stays quoted ("$a") and is piped one-per-line into `read -r` — never word-split. Match ONLY
# the FINAL extensions (.gz / .txt) so an in-flight rotation temp (e.g. a partial .tmp) is never read.
# The timestamp embedded in each archive name sorts LEXICALLY = CHRONOLOGICALLY (more reliable than
# mtime, which a touch/restore can perturb), so `sort` gives true oldest→newest order:
{
  for a in "$root"/.mission-backups/MISSION."$sid".log.*.gz \
           "$root"/.mission-backups/MISSION."$sid".log.*.txt; do
    [ -e "$a" ] || continue          # unmatched glob -> literal -> [ -e ] false -> skip (no failing cmd)
    printf '%s\n' "$a"
  done | sort | while IFS= read -r a; do
    case "$a" in *.gz) gzip -dc "$a" 2>/dev/null;; *) cat "$a" 2>/dev/null;; esac
  done
  cat "$live_log" 2>/dev/null          # ALWAYS read, even with zero archives
} | grep -F '[mission] ' > /tmp/mission-resume.$$ 2>/dev/null || true
# `|| true` above: a fresh/empty log with ZERO `[mission]` lines makes this filter `grep` exit 1.
# Under `set -e -o pipefail` that would ABORT before any state logic runs — but "no `[mission]`
# lines yet" is a VALID ACTIVE state (e.g. empty mission_state + a live MISSION-MODE PLAN ⇒ ACTIVE
# per the §8 active-iff rule), NOT an error. So this no-match — and every derivation no-match below —
# is a normal empty value, never a failure. The capture file may be empty; that is fine.

# Derive the CURRENT part N first — convergence reads MUST be scoped to it (a prior part's final
# dry=2 review line would otherwise bleed into part N+1's convergence math).
# R4 (log-injection defense, S1) — the capture file holds `<idtag>\t<body>` lines, so EVERY control
# derivation is DOUBLE-ANCHORED via `awk -F'\t'`: it keys on BOTH the idtag COLUMN ($1, the exact
# shape mission-write.sh mints and its validator enforces) AND the body prefix ($2). A criticer/note
# free-text line whose BODY merely EMBEDS `[mission] MISSION-CLEARED` (or VOID / PART-DONE) carries a
# NON-matching idtag column, so it can no longer forge control state (a silent HALT, a false
# convergence, or a skipped part). `|| true`: awk exits 0 even on no-match, but the `|| true` is kept
# so an expected empty derivation stays a VALID early state, never a `set -e -o pipefail` abort.

```
**Every grep above whose no-match is an expected/valid outcome appends `|| true`** so that under
`set -e -o pipefail` an empty capture is a NORMAL value (e.g. empty `mission_state` + a live
`MISSION MODE:` PLAN ⇒ ACTIVE; empty `cur_part` ⇒ part 1; empty `last_review` ⇒ no review round
banked yet), never a shell abort. The `|| true` makes the pipeline succeed; the EMPTY string is then
interpreted by the active-iff rule and the decision table as the corresponding valid early state.
(Concatenating archives oldest→newest before the live log preserves chronological order so the final
`tail -1` of any filtered grep picks the genuinely-latest line. The two `.gz`/`.txt` globs cover both
the gzip archive and the no-gzip fallback while excluding any in-flight rotation temp. The
`for … [ -e ] || continue` guard makes this set-e-safe with ZERO archives — an unmatched glob is
skipped without a failing command — so the live log is ALWAYS read even on a fresh mission with no
archives. This is the ONE canonical definition; §2/§5/§9 reference it, never re-spell it.)
The four greps are deliberately distinct: `mission_state` is the **GLOBAL active-iff state gate** (keys
ONLY on CLEARED/REBASELINED); `last_review` drives **convergence** for the CURRENT part (the `2 − dry`
math, part-scoped, VOID-aware); `last_round` (part-scoped, VOID-aware) and `last_progress` (global
lifecycle) are for **resume positioning** only. Never let a transient progress line gate active-iff.

**After `/pre-compact` returns** (or after any compaction), re-derive your position from that
recovered record and continue the **EXACT** `(part, phase, round, dry)`. Read `last_round` for
*positioning* (which part/phase you were in), but compute convergence (`2 − dry`) **ONLY** from
`last_review` (the dedicated part-scoped `phase=review`-or-`VOID` grep) — never from a
`phase=fix`/`plan`/`implement`/`research` line, whose `dry=` is not the convergence count (a non-review
phase line must not drive the `2 − D` math).
- Read `last_review` (the latest part-scoped `phase=review` round line OR a `VOID` for the current
  part): if it is a `phase=review findings=0` line you need `2 − dry` more dry rounds; if it is a `VOID`
  for round K, re-run round K fresh (it banked nothing).
- **Round-ambiguity decision table (the SINGLE reconciliation of §5↔§8 — apply in order):**

  | Last round/progress line for the current part | Resume action |
  |---|---|
  | **`await kind=human ready=0` AND this turn is a REAL USER TURN answering it** (D3 — checked FIRST, before the STOP row below; only a genuine user turn, never a wake tick) | ENTER §12.1 and CONSUME it UNDER the tick lock (step 4), NOT before entering. **C2 — the gated action runs on THIS wake, together with the close; NEVER close (got=1 + resolve) while deferring the action (once got=1 resolves the barrier the C9 reader DROPS it, so a later wake finds nothing to consume — the action would never run).** Once the lock is held, in THIS EXACT order (D14/C2): **(a)** record the outcome — `log … "[mission] DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=<approve\|deny>" "pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>"` with the user's ACTUAL answer (the `<seq>-<slug>` is the `await-state` token's `op`; the barrier stays LIVE at `got=0` with the DECISION — the C9 reader keeps it live so this wake can consume it); **(b)** CONSUME — `approve` ⇒ perform the idempotent gated action; `deny` ⇒ ABORT it; **(c)** close the barrier — `mission-write.sh await … kind=human op=<same-op> part=<same> phase=<same> round=<same> attempt=<same> need=1 got=1` (the `await` verb REFUSES this got=1 close unless the same-op DECISION already exists — DECISION-first is LIB-ENFORCED and the READER also requires it; `got==need` IS the human barrier's resolution, C6; reuse the EXACT fields from the token, D6); **(d)** `resolve <full pd:id>` draining the pending. Order DECISION → action → got=1 → resolve (D14/R7-3): a crash mid-consume leaves a durable DECISION + a LIVE barrier, so the next wake re-CONSUMES (idempotent) — NEVER a removed pd + a ready=0 park with no recorded outcome. **This whole CONSUME IS the wake's ONE transition (R7-11/R6):** go to step 7 and RESCHEDULE — do NOT drive a further transition this turn. Consuming under the lock also stops a queued wake from observing the resolution before this turn holds the lock (R6 — no double-drive). |
  | **`await kind=human ready=0`** on a WAKE tick (AWAIT ROWS FIRST — read via `await-state`, which emits `ready=<0\|1>`; branch on `last_decision` for this barrier's op, derived above) | **(i) `last_decision` is NON-EMPTY (the full resolved-predicate holds — a raw same-op `[mission] DECISION` line alone is NOT enough) ⇒ ANSWERED ⇒ CONSUME it on THIS wake** (a prior turn recorded the outcome but may have crashed before consuming — the C9 reader keeps the `got=0`-with-a-DECISION barrier LIVE for exactly this): `approve` ⇒ perform the idempotent gated action, `deny` ⇒ ABORT it, THEN complete the close (`await … got=1` → `resolve <full pd:id>`, each a no-op if already done). The action runs on THIS wake WITH the close (C2), never split. **NEVER re-ask** — re-issuing `pending-stop` collides on the DECISION idtag and would silently keep the old outcome. **(ii) `last_decision` is EMPTY (UNANSWERED — including a raw DECISION that fails the resolved-predicate: pre-opener, conflicting, or post-close)** ⇒ **STOP the scheduled continuation** and wait for a real user turn (do NOT reschedule, do NOT auto-advance) — the only re-surface case. **(iii) ORPHAN** (got=0, no `- [pd:<op>]` PENDING line AND no DECISION — a prior-crash artifact) ⇒ SURFACE "approval pending but the question text was lost to a prior crash", do NOT proceed. **C7 — the WORKING recovery sequence** (do NOT re-state via `pending-stop`: it FAILS CLOSED rc=14, the lost question is unverifiable): **(1)** write a DECISION for the orphan op = `deny` — `log … "[mission] DECISION op=<orphan-op> outcome=deny" "pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>"`. This is a safe-ABORT, NOT a reconstructed human choice: the lost-question orphan has NO recoverable human answer (the question text died with the pd line), so the ONLY safe outcome is to ABORT the pending action — `deny`. NEVER fabricate an `approve` for a question you can no longer read; **(2)** close the barrier — `await … kind=human op=<orphan-op> … need=1 got=1` (the DECISION now authorizes it; the barrier clears); **(3)** `resolve <full pd:id>` is a MOOT no-op (the pd line is already gone — it returns `already resolved` / `never existed`, harmless). The barrier is now closed with a recorded outcome, no stall loop. If a decision is still genuinely needed, open a FRESH `pending-stop` under a DIFFERENT slug (a new seq). |
  | **`await kind=job ready=0` and a tracked `run_in_background` job is still pending** | collect nothing yet, do not replay a lane — the job's completion is the FAST wake. BUT this turn STILL schedules a fallback heartbeat (§12.1 step 7): a lost completion wake must self-heal — a scheduled wake is the ONLY continuation owner (D1). |
  | **`await kind=job ready=0` and NO tracked job is pending** (the lost-wake safety net) | replay ONLY the missing lane (its `attempt`, its round — the token carries `attempt=A`) and set its got bit on return; OR, if the lane has genuinely timed out, record a timeout/`FAIL` and open `attempt` A+1. Never re-run an already-persisted lane. |
  | **`await kind=job ready=1`** (join-ready — `(got&need)==need`) | reconcile the persisted lane results and bank the single normal successor (the `phase=review … findings=<COUNT>` or VOID line for this round), which SUPERSEDES the AWAIT, then proceed. |
  | **current part's latest progress line is `PART-DONE` or `PART-RETIRED`** (HIGHEST PRIORITY — both are in `last_progress`) | the part is **COMPLETE** → advance to the next part (first re-attempt retirement if `PART-DONE` present but `PART-RETIRED` absent, per the PART-DONE rule below; then await/emit the next `PART-START`). Do **NOT** consult `last_round`/`last_review` for a completed part — a stale prior `phase=review dry=2` line must NOT re-enter already-converged review. |
  | **current part's latest progress line is `PART-START` and NO phase round has been logged yet** (the only line `last_round` carries for this part is the `PART-START` line itself — it has NO `phase=<…> round=<…>` token — and `last_review` is empty: no `phase=` round and no `VOID` banked for this part) | the part has been STARTED but no phase round exists → **BEGIN the part at its first phase, `research`**, then proceed through the part's phase sequence (research → plan → implement → review/fix per Section 5). This is the fresh-part entry state; do NOT consult `last_review` (no review round banked). |
  | `phase=fix` (a fix was in flight) | FINISH the in-flight fix to completion against the working tree, THEN re-run the barrier as the NEXT round K+1. Do not assume the fix finished. |
  | `phase=review` with `findings>0` (ACTIONABLE — `dry` was NOT advanced) | resume into the **FIX of the SAME round K** → log `phase=fix` round=K, apply fixes; do NOT start a fresh review round K+1. (`findings>0` ⇒ this round demands a fix before any new review.) |
  | `phase=review` with `findings=0` (dry-advancing, `dry` already incremented on the line) | start the NEXT FRESH review round K+1 per the `2 − dry` rule. |
  | a `VOID … round=K` is the latest line for round K | re-run round K FRESH (never count it). |
  | last round line is a non-review/non-fix phase (`phase=research` \| `phase=plan` \| `phase=implement`) | CONTINUE that phase's work for the current part to completion, THEN proceed to the review barrier (Section 5). Resume the phase you were in; do not skip ahead and do not consult `last_review` (no review round was banked yet). |

  This table is **TOTAL and mutually-exclusive** over completed-part state (`PART-DONE`/`PART-RETIRED`),
  the fresh-part `PART-START`-with-no-round entry state, and all schema phases (`research`/`plan`/
  `implement`/`review`/`fix`): completed-part progress takes highest precedence over any stale round
  line; the `PART-START`-no-round row covers a part that has been started but has no banked round yet
  (begin at `research`); the round-line rows cover `fix` and the two `review` substates and `VOID`; and
  the non-review/non-fix catch-all covers the remaining `research`/`plan`/`implement` phases once a round
  line for the part exists — every recoverable state maps to exactly one row.

  **Never re-run an idtag round you already banked** (a banked `findings=0` review or a completed fix
  is a no-op that wastes a compaction). `findings=<COUNT>` on the round line is the cross-check that
  disambiguates the two `phase=review` rows above: `findings=0` ⇒ dry-advancing (next fresh round);
  `findings>0` ⇒ actionable (must reach `phase=fix` first) — so it is a live resume input, not dead
  weight.
- **PART-DONE / next-part:** if the last `[mission]` line FOR THE CURRENT PART is `PART-DONE`, the part
  converged — do NOT re-resume it. **First check retirement:** if a `PART-DONE part=<N>` is present in
  the recovered set but no `PART-RETIRED part=<N>` is (both are in the `last_progress` token set, so
  scan the filtered `/tmp/mission-resume.$$` for each), re-attempt the idempotent plan retirement
  (Section 5) BEFORE advancing. Then advance to the next part: find the latest `PART-START part=<M>`
  (if present, resume part M); if no later `PART-START` exists yet, log `PART-START part=<N+1>`
  (Section 5/7) and begin its Phase 1. **Never restart converged work** and never re-run review rounds
  you already banked.
- A `VOID part=<N> … round=<K>` line means round K did not count → re-run round K fresh (Section 6/7).
- `test-trust part=<N>` recovered = honored; absent = unresolved → re-assess before implementing (§5/§9).

**Mode is ACTIVE iff** PLAN line-1 is a `MISSION MODE:` token **AND** the active-iff state gate says so.
The state gate keys **ONLY** on `mission_state` (the dedicated `MISSION-(CLEARED|REBASELINED)` grep
above) — NEVER on a transient progress line (PART-START/PART-DONE/test-trust/VOID can NOT gate
active-iff; lumping them in would let a transient line resurrect a cleared mission or leave an
undefined case):
- `mission_state` latest is `MISSION-CLEARED` → **INACTIVE** (the mission is over; resume normally, not
  in mission mode).
- `mission_state` latest is `MISSION-REBASELINED status=active` → **ACTIVE** (a sid re-seeded via
  `rebaseline` after a prior clear is reactivated; the rebaseline line is the latest CLEARED/REBASELINED
  token and overrides the stale earlier CLEARED).
- `mission_state` is EMPTY (no CLEARED/REBASELINED ever) but PLAN line-1 IS a `MISSION MODE:` token and
  a live PLAN exists → **ACTIVE** (a normal in-flight mission that has never been cleared).
Progress lines (`last_progress`) are read SEPARATELY, for resume positioning only (which part/phase to
re-enter), and never change the active/inactive decision.

## 9. PLAN-challenge · batched questions · full agency · test-trustworthiness

- **PLAN challenges:** never silently edit PLAN. A divergence goes to the append-only PLAN CHALLENGES
  lane via `challenge` (loud, surfaced in the banner). The human ratifies; if away, proceed with a
  loudly-logged deviation.
- **Batched questions — DEFAULT TO AWAY in autonomous mission mode.** `AskUserQuestion` blocks
  indefinitely, and "is the user present" is **not decidable mid-run**. So when away (the default in
  an autonomous run): log the assumption + proceed (loud deviation). Only surface ONE consolidated
  `AskUserQuestion` round (draining PENDING DECISIONS) when the run is **explicitly interactive** /
  there is a recent user turn. Never block an unattended run on a modal. (When you do ask, include the
  current context-usage % in the question text, per global rules.)
- **Run-timing — points of contact (advisory).** A "point of contact" is a surface where the run
  genuinely hands back to the user: (1) the batched `AskUserQuestion` round above, (2) the 5-FAIL
  STOP-LOUD (§10), (3) the corrupt-bridge STOP-LOUD (§10), and (4) the natural lifecycle close (§11).
  At each, just BEFORE surfacing, record the timing contact and show the elapsed line:
  ```bash
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh timing-contact <sid> <root> <ask|fail5|corrupt>
  . "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"; set -- $(mission_timing_compute <sid> <root>)
  printf '⏱ stretch %s · active %s · wall %s · idle %s\n' "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$1")" "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$2")" "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$3")" "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$4")"
  ```
  **Render that `⏱` line directly into the AskUserQuestion question text and into the STOP-LOUD message
  body** — not only the banner. A **PLAN-divergence `challenge` is NOT a point of contact** (it proceeds
  autonomously when away) — do not emit a contact there. Timing is advisory: a failed emit never blocks
  or changes the lifecycle (at a corrupt-bridge contact the write itself may no-op — that's fine; the
  read-side `⏱` still renders, or shows `timing unavailable`).
- **Unattended blocking surfaces extend to `/implement`'s gates.** The away-default above applies to
  ANY surface that would block an unattended run — including `/implement`'s **dangerous-command
  Manual-Steps gate**. When away: do NOT block on that modal; log a `pending` PENDING-DECISION (the
  decision text + context-usage %) and proceed-or-stop per the away policy, exactly like a batched
  question. The decision stays in the queue for the next interactive turn.
- **Credential / external-side-effect / destructive guard (autonomous mode).** Full-agency,
  credential, external-side-effect, or destructive skills — e.g. anything that loads or moves credentials, exfils
  secrets, mutates production, or performs irreversible external actions — require a **human decision in
  autonomous mode. Do NOT auto-run them.** These are BLOCKING: open the stop with a single
  `pending-stop` call (the atomic human-`AWAIT` opener — §10/§12.3). The question is untrusted content,
  so CAPTURE it into a variable first (a quoted `<<'EOF'` heredoc or a file), then pass it DOUBLE-quoted:
  `q=$(cat qfile); bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh pending-stop <sid> <root> <slug> <part> <round> <attempt> <phase> "$q"`
  — NEVER a `'<q>'` single-quoted literal (an embedded `'`, even a benign apostrophe, breaks out and
  executes) NOR a `"<raw text>"` double-quoted literal (an embedded `$(...)`/backtick executes); a
  captured `"$q"` is inert against both. Describe what wants to run and why, then PARK on the barrier until a real user turn closes
  it (DECISION → got=1 → resolve). These are the one class where "proceed loudly when away" does NOT apply
  — the human must ratify before such a skill runs; a plain NON-BLOCKING `pending` would NOT stop the loop.
- **Full agency (spine not cage).** The four-skill sequence is the backbone, not a fence. You are free
  to invoke ANY kit skill whenever it helps — `/script` to prove load-bearing assumptions before
  building (encouraged), `/investigate`, `/document`, etc. (Credential/destructive skills
  are gated by the guard above — they need a human PENDING decision in autonomous
  mode. If the project needs API keys, put the keys your project needs in a `.env` file (never
  commit it) before the mission starts.)
- **Test-trustworthiness** is both a plan-time precondition and a deliverable (see Section 5, Phase 2):
  no deleting or weakening tests to pass; meaningful coverage before "converged" means anything.

## 10. Guardrails — stop LOUD

**ALERT ON EVERY PATH THAT ENDS OR PARKS WORK — `PushNotification`, immediately, before you stop.**
An autonomous run exists because the user is asleep or away; a stop that only writes to a terminal
nobody is watching converts "the mission needs you" into "the mission is silently dead until morning",
which is the failure this whole playbook is built to avoid. Fire one on **all four §10 paths below**
(5-FAIL, `panel-unavailable-3x`, `void-count -1`, corrupt bridge), on the **§6.1 cap-exhausted park**,
on the **§12.1 step 4b `part-over-budget` park**, and on the **§12 stall detector**. A park still
alerts even though the mission continues — the user needs to know a part was set aside with a
disposition, not discover it later in the log.

Say which trigger fired, which part, and what is owed. For `panel-unavailable-3x` the message MUST
**distinguish quota exhaustion from a Codex outage** — one overnight run died of the former and read
as the latter, and they need opposite responses (wait vs. re-run). If `PushNotification` itself fails,
that is not a reason to skip the stop: stop anyway and surface the notify failure too.

**Every STOP-LOUD path below is a WAKE stop condition (§12.3): the wake RETURNS WITHOUT rescheduling** —
release the tick lock, surface, and stop. A STOP-LOUD must NEVER schedule the next self-wake (that would
loop a wedged mission forever). For a **mandatory human decision** (the §9 credential / destructive /
external-side-effect guard, or any genuinely blocking decision), the stop sequence is a SINGLE call:
`q=$(cat qfile); bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh pending-stop <sid> <root> <slug> <part> <round> <attempt> <phase> "$q"` (capture the untrusted
question into `"$q"` via a quoted heredoc/file and pass it double-quoted; a single-quoted literal breaks
on an apostrophe, a double-quoted raw literal executes `$(...)`; §7 rule) — it ATOMICALLY opens the FULL-FIELD human
`AWAIT kind=human op=<seq>-<slug> attempt=1 need=1 got=0` STOP barrier AND mints the pd in ONE lock, then
ECHOES `id=pd:<seq>-<slug>` (CAPTURE it — you need the FULL id for the eventual `resolve` and the
`<seq>-<slug>` for the DECISION `op`). Do NOT hand-open a second `await` barrier (the atomic verb already
opened it), and do NOT substitute plain `pending` here (plain `pending` is NON-BLOCKING and does not stop
the loop — §9). Then stop. The outstanding
`AWAIT kind=human` keeps the §8 rows parked until a real user turn CLOSES it in order — DECISION → `await
… got=1` → `resolve` (§8 D3 row / §12.3); the `await` verb REFUSES the got=1 close until the DECISION
exists (DECISION-first, lib-enforced).

- **5 FAILs for the SAME part+phase in the LOG** → **STOP LOUD.** Count from the durable record
  (the guard can't live in volatile context): the resume-read idiom (Section 8) recovers FAIL lines,
  and because each FAIL is attempt-scoped (`m<N>-fail-<reason>-<attempt>`, Section 7) the lib does NOT
  dedup them, so 5 distinct lines for the same `part=<N> phase=<P>` actually accumulate and the guard
  can fire. Tally `[mission] FAIL part=<N> phase=<P> …` lines per part+phase — **GEN-SLICED: count
  only lines after the latest gen-matching `MISSION-REBASELINED` boundary** (Section 7's gen rules;
  a prior generation's FAILs never trip this generation's guard); at 5, STOP LOUD — do not
  burn hours wrong.
- **`panel-unavailable-3x` (NAMED IMMEDIATE trigger)** → **STOP LOUD the moment it is logged** (the
  Section 5 void-count block emits it at exactly 3 consecutive VOIDs for one round). Do NOT wait for
  the 5-FAIL tally — during a permanent panel outage the same round can never advance, so no further
  FAILs would ever accrue and the run would loop forever. Surface to the user / away-policy
  checkpoint; do not re-run the panel again.
- **`void-count` returns `-1` (gen-boundary-mismatch / refused gen-sliced read)** → treat as the
  corrupt-bridge point of contact below: do NOT treat as count=0, do NOT advance the part; the
  write-path self-heal (or the user) must repair the boundary first.
- **A corrupt or unreadable bridge** → **STOP LOUD**, surface it to the user, point them at the
  `.mission-backups/` under the canonical root; do not silently proceed. This guard is WIRED to the
  status-line parse (Section 7): any `mission-write.sh` call returning `FAILED rc=2` (corrupt — the
  lib's `mission_verify` failed under the lock) triggers this STOP-LOUD immediately. (Also triggers
  if a direct `mission_verify` you run fails.)

---

## 11. Lifecycle — clear + status

**The wake self-terminates at the lifecycle close (§12.3).** Once the `MISSION-CLEARED` line is banked
(any `status=achieved|could-not|cleared`), the mission is INACTIVE per the §8 active-iff rule, and every
later wake — check active-iff `mission_state` on EVERY wake, BEFORE archive-close — self-terminates
(returns without rescheduling). The natural close is therefore the ONE §9 point-of-contact where the
self-wake loop stops on purpose: `timing-close` → `MISSION-CLEARED` → `archive-close` LAST → wake stops.

- **`/mission clear [reason]`** logs `[mission] MISSION-CLEARED status=cleared reason=<slug>` with an
  **EMPTY idtag** (lifecycle lines always append — a dedup-prone idtag would suppress a re-clear that
  follows a `rebaseline` and leave the mission spuriously active; §2) and ends the mission early
  (mirrors `/goal clear`). `achieved` / `could-not` are set only by the **explicit
  lifecycle close** at a mission's natural end — write the appropriate `status=` on the MISSION-CLEARED
  line — never by the bare `clear` verb. Parse the returned status line (Section 7).
- **Run-timing — lifecycle close (the ONE ledger write).** Immediately BEFORE writing the
  `MISSION-CLEARED status=<achieved|could-not|cleared>` line (whether from `clear` or the natural-end
  close), flush the final timing + lifetime-ledger record and surface the final elapsed line to the user:
  ```bash
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh timing-close <sid> <root> <achieved|could-not|cleared>
  . "$HOME/.claude-kit/scripts/hooks/lib/mission-bridge.sh"; set -- $(mission_timing_compute <sid> <root>)
  printf '⏱ final — active %s · wall %s · idle %s (run /mission stats for lifetime totals)\n' "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$2")" "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$3")" "$(_mission_fmt_dur "$4")"
  ```
  This appends one rich record to `~/.claude/mission-metrics.jsonl` (the machine-wide lifetime ledger
  that `/mission stats` reads). Advisory — never blocks the close.
- **Archive — lifecycle close (the LAST step).** AFTER the entire timing block above AND after the
  `MISSION-CLEARED status=<achieved|could-not>` line is durably written, file the now-closed mission's
  files into `<root>/.mission-archive/<sid>/` so the root stays clean. This must be the FINAL close
  action — it moves the very log the timing block reads, so it runs strictly last:
  ```bash
  bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh archive-close <sid> <root>
  ```
  Advisory — the `archive-close` self-guard no-ops unless the mission is `cleared`, and a failed move
  never blocks the close. (A `/mission clear` already archives in §2; a double-fire is a harmless no-op.)
  Then **disarm the liveness guard** (§12.1 step 0) so a finished run stops being watched:
  ```bash
  rm -f "$HOME/.claude/progress/mission-liveness-<sid>.json"
  ```
  Advisory and idempotent — a missed disarm is self-correcting rather than harmful: the guard reads
  `mission_lifecycle_state`, sees `cleared`, and exits silent on every subsequent turn. Leaving the
  file behind therefore costs a stat and a state read, never a spurious block.
- **`/mission status`** (and blank) reads the LOG **directly** via the Section 8 resume-read idiom
  (grep over the full live log + ALL rotated archives oldest→newest), derives mode/part/phase/round/dry
  + pending, and prints — no mutation. Mode/`status=` come from the `mission_state` grep (the LATEST
  `MISSION-(CLEARED|REBASELINED)` line — Section 8 active-iff), NOT from a transient progress line.

## 12. The mission wake routine (self-wake — the continuation-owner mechanism)

This section is the operational body of the **CONTINUATION-OWNER INVARIANT** in the contract core: a
`/mission` turn NEVER yields naked. When a turn has work still owed and is not at a genuine human-handback
/ stop point (§9/§12.3), it **schedules its own next wake as its LAST continuation-deciding call (only the
tick-lock release may follow)** and then returns — ALWAYS,
even when a tracked `run_in_background` job is pending (D1: the completion is the fast wake, the scheduled
heartbeat is the backstop that self-heals a lost completion wake; a scheduled wake is the ONLY continuation
owner). **EVERY wake source funnels through the ONE routine below** — a tracked
background-job completion, a `ScheduleWakeup` tick, AND a post-compact resume — and each advances the
mission by **exactly ONE transition**. What makes 2-3 queued/racing wakes safe is a LAYERED guard, in
priority order: (1) the `mkdir` tick-lock SERIALIZES wakes — only the holder acts; a wake that finds the
lock fresh-held reschedules and returns without touching state, so overlapping wakes do not run
concurrently; (2) each wake re-reads CURRENT state (§8) and the AWAIT marker and picks the NEXT transition
off it, so a wake that runs AFTER the winner released the lock sees the advanced state and never repeats
the banked step; (3) the existing deterministic idtags make any accidental re-bank an idempotent no-op;
(4) the cursor-compare (step 5) catches state changing UNDER a holder mid-decision (e.g. a concurrent note
write) and re-enters. The cursor alone does NOT dedupe queued wakes (a wake that recomputes its baseline
after the winner's append would see it "unchanged") — the tick-lock + read-current-state is the real
serializer; the cursor is the in-turn consistency check on top.

### 12.1 The wake routine (run on every wake — idempotent)

Carry `sid`, `root`, and every absolute path in the tick prompt itself (§12.2) — a wake has NO
conversation memory; treat it as a COLD START and read ALL state from the log/bridge.

0. **ARM the liveness guard (belt-and-braces; `mission-write.sh` already arms on any bridge write, so
   this step is a redundancy, not the only path).** Arming ONLY here was a real coverage gap: a
   mission driven entirely by USER turns never runs a wake routine, so it never armed and the guard
   was inert for it — and the conversational-to-overnight handoff ("continue, I'm going to bed") is
   exactly that population. The writer now arms on `create`/`log`/`note`/`challenge`/`pending`, so any
   session doing mission work is covered whatever drove the turn. The `Stop` hook
   `scripts/hooks/mission-liveness.sh` catches a turn that ends with work owed and no `ScheduleWakeup`
   in it — the naked yield §12.5 describes — and blocks the stop so the run continues instead of
   freezing. **It is inert until armed, and it is armed per-session, ON PURPOSE:** an always-on
   version would fire on every turn end of every window on the machine, and because several windows
   routinely sit in the same repo it would drive a mission tick into a SIBLING window or into the
   user's own live conversation. Re-arming every wake is deliberate — it self-heals if the file is
   ever lost, and the write is idempotent:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/progress" 2>/dev/null
   printf '{"sid":"%s","root":"%s"}' "<sid>" "<root>" > "$HOME/.claude/progress/mission-liveness-<sid>.json"
   ```
   The guard reads `root` from THIS file (never from `cwd`, which is often a per-part worktree) and
   resolves the mission by `sid`, so it can never adopt another session's mission. Retire it at the
   natural close, beside `archive-close` (§11):
   `rm -f "$HOME/.claude/progress/mission-liveness-<sid>.json"`.
   Everything it decides is appended to `~/.claude/logs/mission-liveness.log`, so "ran and stayed
   silent" is distinguishable from "never ran".
1. **Acquire the tick lock (atomic mkdir lock).** The lock dir lives beside the mission file:
   `tick_dir="$root/.mission-backups/tick.$sid.lock"`.
   ```bash
   i_own_lock=0
   if mkdir "$tick_dir" 2>/dev/null; then i_own_lock=1   # acquired — you own this tick
   else
     # held: stat its mtime. FRESH (<15m) -> another turn owns it: reschedule 60s + RETURN, and do NOT
     #   touch the lock (you never acquired it). STALE (>15m) -> the owning tick crashed: rm -rf + retry
     #   the mkdir ONCE (set i_own_lock=1 only if the retry mkdir SUCCEEDS).
     # D5 — if the retry mkdir ALSO FAILS (another wake won the race in between), i_own_lock STAYS 0:
     #   reschedule 60s + RETURN. NEVER fall through into step 2+ with i_own_lock=0 (that is two owners
     #   driving the same tick). Only an acquired lock proceeds.
     # R4 — a non-owner reschedule (FRESH-held OR D5 retry-lost) holds NO lock, so it cannot write a
     #   lock-held fallback: if that ScheduleWakeup itself FAILS, retry ONCE, then STOP-LOUD (surface it).
     #   The lock-owner is presumably still driving its own wake, but a doubly-failed schedule is a real
     #   degradation that must never be a silent naked yield.
     # SLEEP-SKEW GRACE: if THIS wake is itself >10m later than its scheduled fire (laptop slept),
     #   give the held lock ONE more 60s grace wake before treating it as stale — a suspended owner's
     #   lock must not be cleared out from under it.
     :
   fi
   # HARD GUARD (pseudocode): if you did not acquire the lock, you have already rescheduled above —
   #   [ "$i_own_lock" = 1 ] || { <return from the wake now>; }   # NEVER run steps 2-7 without the lock
   ```
   D14 (ABA, bounded — NOT fully proof): the stale-clear+reacquire is not ABA-proof (two wakes can both
   judge the lock stale in the same window). The layered guard (cursor recompute at step 5 + the AWAIT
   marker + deterministic idtags) dedupes any double LOG transition (idtag-keyed appends are idempotent)
   and catches the common interleaving (whoever writes first moves the cursor; the other re-enters). It
   does NOT by itself prevent a double EXTERNAL dispatch (spawning a review panel, a worktree mutation) in
   the rare window where BOTH wakes recompute the cursor before EITHER writes — so before any non-idempotent
   dispatch, step 6 RE-READS `await-state` and skips the launch if that lane's bit is already set or a
   tracked job is pending, and every launched lane's usable result is persisted to DURABLE NOTES BEFORE
   its got bit is set, so a duplicate lane re-derives rather than corrupts. The re-read + the tick lock
   keep the window rare but do NOT fully close it: a run-id / lease that would make a duplicate EXTERNAL
   dispatch reliably detectable is NOT yet wired into the launch path — it is a documented deferred
   follow-up (do not claim it as present).
   **Release the lock on every exit path THAT ACQUIRED IT (`i_own_lock=1`)** — the stop conditions, the
   cursor-changed re-enter, and the normal end. A turn that found the lock FRESH-held (and rescheduled
   without acquiring) must **NOT** release it — deleting a lock you do not own hands two turns the same
   tick. Forgetting to release a lock you DO own blocks the mission for 15 minutes before it self-heals.
2. **Verify the bridge, then run the EXISTING §8 archive-inclusive resume-read** (pure/idempotent — the
   grep-over-ALL-archives-then-live-log idiom; NOT `tail`, NOT the newest archive only). Any
   `FAILED rc=2` / failed `mission_verify` → the §10 corrupt-bridge STOP-LOUD (do NOT reschedule).
3. **`cursor_before`** = the rotation-invariant digest of the current-gen `[mission]` state stream:
   ```bash
   cursor_before=$(bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh cursor-hash "$sid" "$root")
   ```
   If it is the literal `corrupt` (a refused gen-boundary read — the rollover/corruption window) OR EMPTY
   (C1 — a missing sha tool / unreadable state also fails, and two empties would falsely compare equal),
   take the §10 corrupt-bridge STOP-LOUD: release the lock, do NOT reschedule, surface it. Neither
   `corrupt` nor empty is ever a valid cursor — never treat it as "unchanged".
4. **Apply the §8/§H decision table** (AWAIT rows FIRST, then the round-ambiguity grid) plus the
   `await-state` verb → select exactly **ONE** next transition. `await-state` returns bare `none`,
   `corrupt`, or `await kind=… op=… part=<N> round=<K> attempt=<A> phase=<P> need=<M> got=<G>
   ready=<0|1> started_at=<E>` (field order matches the lib's emit; `phase` is reused on the human close):
   ```bash
   aw=$(bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh await-state "$sid" "$root")
   ```
   `corrupt` → §10 corrupt-bridge STOP-LOUD (release lock, do NOT reschedule).
   `await kind=human ready=0` → branch on `last_decision` for the op (§8, D15): **`last_decision` is
   NON-EMPTY** (the full resolved-predicate holds — a raw same-op `[mission] DECISION` line alone is NOT
   enough) ⇒ ANSWERED ⇒ CONSUME on THIS tick — `approve` ⇒ perform the idempotent gated
   action, `deny` ⇒ ABORT it, THEN finish the close (`await … got=1` → `resolve`, each a no-op if already
   done); the action runs WITH the close on THIS wake, never split (C2); NEVER re-ask. **EMPTY `last_decision`
   on a WAKE tick** (UNANSWERED, regardless of any raw DECISION line present) ⇒ STOP the scheduled continuation (a human hand-back is owed; an ORPHAN — no `pd:<op>` line
   either — ⇒ surface it + recover per §12.1 (iii) C7: `log` a DECISION `deny` for the orphan op → `await …
   got=1` close → `resolve` (moot); do NOT re-state via `pending-stop` (fails closed rc=14 — unverifiable);
   do NOT proceed). **On a REAL USER TURN answering it (D3):** CONSUME it HERE, UNDER this tick lock, in
   THIS order (D14/C2): (a) `log` the `[mission] DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=<approve|deny>` (idtag
   `pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>`) with the user's ACTUAL answer (the barrier stays LIVE at `got=0` with the
   DECISION — the C9 reader keeps it live so this same wake can consume it); (b) CONSUME — `approve` ⇒ run
   the idempotent gated action, `deny` ⇒ ABORT it; (c) append the SAME barrier with `got=1` (reuse the EXACT
   op/part/phase/round/attempt/need from the token, D6 — the `await` verb REFUSES got=1 until the same-op
   DECISION exists, DECISION-first lib-enforced AND reader-enforced); (d) `resolve` the pd whose UNIQUE
   `<seq>-<slug>` matches the token's `op`. **C2 — NEVER close (got=1 + resolve) while deferring the action
   to a later wake: once `got=1` resolves the barrier the C9 reader DROPS it, so a deferred wake finds
   nothing to consume and the approved action never runs.** Order DECISION → action → got=1 → resolve
   (D14/R7-3): a crash mid-consume leaves a durable DECISION + a LIVE barrier, so the next wake re-CONSUMES
   idempotently — NOT a removed pd + a ready=0 park with no recorded outcome. This whole CONSUME IS this
   wake's ONE transition (R7-11/R6): go straight to step 7 and RESCHEDULE — do NOT re-enter step 5 to drive
   a FURTHER transition this turn. Consuming under the lock (NOT before entering §12.1) stops a queued wake
   from racing the resolution (R6 — no double-drive).
   `await kind=job ready=0` + a tracked job pending → do NOT replay a lane this tick (the completion is
   the fast wake), but STILL fall through to step 7 and schedule a fallback heartbeat (D1).
   `await kind=job ready=0` + NO tracked job → replay ONLY the missing lane, but ONLY once the barrier has
   aged past a lane timeout (started_at older than ~the lane's max runtime); a cold tick cannot tell a
   still-running job from a lost wake, so a fresh barrier just reschedules and waits (D11). On a genuine
   timeout, record a timeout/`FAIL` and open attempt A+1 (its `attempt=A` is in the token). `await
   kind=job ready=1` → reconcile + bank the single successor.
4a. **READ THE STALL ALERT (one file, then delete it).** `mission-liveness.sh` samples the cursor on
   every armed turn end and, after `MISSION_LIVENESS_STALL_TICKS` (default 12) ticks with the state
   stream unchanged, writes `~/.claude/progress/mission-liveness/<sid>.stall-alert`. It cannot tell
   you directly — a stalled mission books a wake every tick, so the hook's own check passes and it
   stays silent, and a `Stop` hook can only reach the model by BLOCKING, which is wrong for an
   advisory. So the hand-off is state:
   ```bash
   ML_STALL="$HOME/.claude/progress/mission-liveness/<sid>.stall-alert"
   [ -f "$ML_STALL" ] && { cat "$ML_STALL"; rm -f "$ML_STALL"; }   # alert, then clear
   ```
   Present ⇒ **fire `PushNotification`** naming the part and the tick count, record a `challenge`, and
   re-examine what this part is actually doing before dispatching again. Booking wakes forever while
   the tree never moves is the failure shape that produced one part out of eight in eleven hours. It
   is ADVISORY — it never blocks and never parks the part on its own; the §12.1 step 4b brake below is
   what actually ends an over-budget part.

4b. **PER-PART SPEND BRAKE — evaluated HERE, before any dispatch.** One part must not be allowed to
   eat the whole night. This is the ONLY rule in this playbook that would have interrupted the
   eleven-hour single-part run that motivated it; the review-round cap (§6.1) would not have, because
   that run reached only three rounds.

   Both thresholds are **named settings carrying defaults**, not constants — one night of evidence
   should be enough to tune them without editing prose:

   | Setting | Default | Source |
   |---|---|---|
   | `MISSION_PART_MAX_TICKS` | `25` | wake ticks since this part's `PART-START` (count them in the log) |
   | `MISSION_PART_MAX_MINUTES` | `90` | wall-clock since the `PART-START` line's timestamp |

   ```
   part_ticks   = wake ticks since this part's PART-START
   part_elapsed = wall-clock since this part's PART-START

     part_ticks >= MISSION_PART_MAX_TICKS  OR  part_elapsed >= MISSION_PART_MAX_MINUTES
       -> the part is OVER BUDGET. Take the §6.1 cap-exhausted step-aside path VERBATIM:
          pending-stop -> PushNotification -> FAIL ... reason=part-over-budget
          with the same REQUIRED disposition= field -> PART-RETIRED part=N -> PART-START part=N+1
   ```

   **A second reason slug, not a second mechanism** — `reason=part-over-budget` re-uses the
   cap-exhausted park exactly, so there is one park path to reason about and one to test. Whichever
   threshold trips first wins; do not wait for both. Like the cap, this PARKS the part and advances
   the mission; it is never a STOP-LOUD (that would freeze every part still owed).

5. **Immediately before dispatching/banking, RECOMPUTE the cursor.** If it changed, another wake already
   advanced the mission — DISCARD this decision, but do NOT yield: the mission still needs a continuation
   owner. Release the lock and **RE-ENTER the routine from step 1** (re-acquire, re-read the now-advanced
   state, pick the NEXT transition). This is a normal in-turn loop, not a return. BOUNDED (D7): keep a
   `reenter_count` for THIS wake (it resets per wake, NEVER per re-enter). Allow at most **2** re-enters;
   on the 3rd cursor-change (another wake is actively driving), skip banking and go straight to step 7 to
   schedule a short heartbeat, then RETURN — never a bare naked return. An EMPTY or `corrupt` cursor is a
   fail, never "unchanged":
   ```bash
   cursor_now=$(bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh cursor-hash "$sid" "$root")
   # pseudocode — this block runs inside the wake routine, not a shell function:
   #   if [ -z "$cursor_now" ] || [ "$cursor_now" = corrupt ]; then release_lock; STOP-LOUD (§10); fi  # C1: empty is NOT "unchanged"
   #   if [ "$cursor_now" != "$cursor_before" ]; then reenter_count=$((reenter_count+1))
   #        if [ "$reenter_count" -le 2 ]; then release_lock; goto step 1;   # re-acquire in step 1
   #        else goto step 7 STILL HOLDING the lock (step 7 schedules the heartbeat + releases — do NOT
   #             release here, or the schedule-failure fallback write would be lock-free); fi
   #   fi
   ```
6. **Bank / dispatch the transition** using the EXISTING deterministic idtags (`ok` = appended or an
   idempotent no-op; `COLLISION` → re-read and reconcile, never assume the line banked). A bank/dispatch
   write that returns `FAILED` is load-bearing control state (§intro): retry, then §10 STOP-LOUD if it
   still fails — do NOT proceed to step 7 as if it banked.
7. **Schedule the next wake UNLESS a stop condition holds** (§12.3).
   **STEP 7 IS THE MANDATORY EXIT GATE: no path in this routine returns except through it.** Step 6 is
   the act that FEELS like completion, and step 7 is a separate later errand — which is exactly why it
   gets dropped, and a dropped step 7 silently freezes the mission forever (nothing retries it; see
   §12.5). Do not treat step 6's success as permission to end the turn. Several paths above reach step 7
   while deliberately skipping step 6 (the CONSUME path, the `await kind=job ready=0` heartbeat, the
   re-enter-exhausted path); that is intended — they still exit through here.
   D10 — ORDER matters: call
   `ScheduleWakeup` while STILL HOLDING the lock, then release only after you know the outcome (so a
   schedule failure`s durable fallback write is never done lock-free). Call it with:
   - `delaySeconds`: a **~60s floor** when a transition is actively in flight; a **longer fallback
     heartbeat** (up to the **3300s** /mission ceiling) while a tracked `run_in_background` job is
     pending — do NOT poll a 40-minute job every 60s; the completion wake is primary, the heartbeat is
     just the backstop if that wake is ever lost. The tool clamps `delaySeconds` to [60, 3600]s;
     **/mission caps at 3300** so a wake lands inside the 1h prompt-cache TTL — a 3600s wake lands just
     past it and re-caches the whole context (~360k tokens measured) instead of ~1k. Never pass >3300.
   - `prompt`: the SAME self-contained tick body (§12.2), verbatim.
   - `reason`: e.g. `"mission <sid> tick"`.
   - **On SUCCESS** → release the lock and **RETURN immediately** (nothing else this turn).
   - **On FAILURE** (C12/D10) → retry ONCE; if it still fails, do NOT yield naked: while STILL holding the
     lock, write the durable human-handback fallback (`pending-stop …` per §12.3 — the atomic barrier
     opener), THEN release the lock and STOP LOUD so the user sees it. A failed schedule is never a silent stop.

### 12.2 The self-contained tick prompt (cold-start-safe)

`ScheduleWakeup` only fires **while Claude Code is OPEN**; state survival across compaction/close is via
the on-disk log + this self-contained prompt, NOT via wake persistence — so the prompt must carry
everything a cold start needs and must re-derive ALL position from the §8 resume-read. Substitute these
FIVE absolute values — `<SID>` is the sanitized session id, `<ROOT>` the canonical mission root,
`<MFILE>` the mission artifact, `<PLAYBOOK>` this mission.md, `<MW>` the mission-write.sh CLI. R4 —
BEFORE substituting, verify NONE contains a newline OR any of `"` `` ` `` `$` `\`: the cold prompt embeds
`<ROOT>` inside a double-quoted `mkdir "<ROOT>/…"`, so an unescaped quote / `$()` / backtick would break
the quoting and inject shell expansion. If any value contains a newline or such a metacharacter the
substitution is malformed — abort and STOP-LOUD rather than emit a prompt an attacker path could inject
into. Pass this body verbatim as the `prompt`:

```
You are resuming an autonomous /mission tick for sid <SID> at root <ROOT>.
Files: mission artifact <MFILE> (4 zones: PLAN + DURABLE NOTES + PLAN CHALLENGES + PENDING DECISIONS; the LOG is the separate .log sidecar) | bridge CLI <MW> | full playbook <PLAYBOOK>.
You have NO memory of prior ticks — COLD START. Read ALL state from the log/bridge; carry nothing.
Run the §12.1 mission wake routine EXACTLY (use <MW> for every bridge verb: cursor-hash/await-state/log):
  1. mkdir "<ROOT>/.mission-backups/tick.<SID>.lock" (mkdir lock: fresh<15m -> reschedule 60s + return WITHOUT
     touching the lock; stale>15m -> clear+retry once; >10m-delayed wake -> one 60s sleep-skew grace).
     Track i_own_lock; release ONLY a lock you acquired, on every exit that acquired it.
  2. Verify the bridge + run the §8 archive-inclusive resume-read (corrupt -> §10 STOP-LOUD, no reschedule).
  3. cursor_before = <MW> cursor-hash (literal `corrupt` -> §10 STOP-LOUD, no reschedule).
  4. <MW> await-state + the §8/§H decision table (AWAIT rows FIRST) -> ONE transition. Token: none|corrupt|
     `await kind=<job|human> ... attempt=A need=M got=G ready=<0|1>`. corrupt -> §10 STOP-LOUD.
  5. Recompute cursor-hash; if changed, DISCARD + RE-ENTER at step 1 (never a bare return); if still
     churning after a couple re-reads, go to step 7 and schedule a short heartbeat.
  6. Bank/dispatch with the existing idtags (FAILED -> retry, then §10 STOP-LOUD; never proceed).
  7. If a §12.3 stop condition holds, release the lock and RETURN WITHOUT rescheduling. Else call
     ScheduleWakeup WHILE STILL HOLDING the lock (delaySeconds in [60,3300] — 60s floor / long heartbeat
     capped at 3300s to stay inside the 1h cache TTL, even while a tracked job is pending, prompt = THIS SAME body, reason); it is the LAST continuation-
     deciding call (only the tick-lock release may follow), and the lock release FOLLOWS its outcome. On SUCCESS release the lock + RETURN. On FAILURE retry once; if
     it still fails, write the pending-stop fallback (the atomic human-STOP opener) UNDER the lock, THEN release + STOP-LOUD;
     never yield naked. Then RETURN.
Read the PLAYBOOK <PLAYBOOK> (its CONTRACT CORE + §5/§8/§10/§11/§12) for full detail before acting.

### 12.3 Stop conditions (when a wake self-terminates — do NOT reschedule)

A wake **RETURNS WITHOUT rescheduling** — releasing the tick lock, then stopping — when ANY holds
(these are the §10 STOP-LOUD paths and the §11 lifecycle close, wired to the wake):
- **`MISSION-CLEARED` banked** (`status=achieved|could-not|cleared`) — check active-iff `mission_state`
  (§8) on EVERY wake BEFORE archive-close; once the latest lifecycle line is `MISSION-CLEARED`, the
  mission is INACTIVE and every later wake self-terminates. The natural close order (§11) is
  `timing-close` → `MISSION-CLEARED` → `archive-close` LAST → then the wake stops.
- **A named STOP-LOUD**: 5 FAILs for the same part+phase, `panel-unavailable-3x` the moment it is
  logged, `void-count` returning `-1`, or a corrupt/unreadable bridge (`FAILED rc=2`). None reschedule.
- **A mandatory human decision** (credential / destructive / external-side-effect skill, or any
  genuinely blocking decision): open the stop with a SINGLE atomic call —
  `q=$(cat qfile); bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh pending-stop <sid> <root> <slug> <part> <round> <attempt> <phase> "$q"` (SS7 — the question is
  untrusted mission-derived content: CAPTURE it into `"$q"` via a quoted heredoc/file and pass it
  double-quoted; NEVER inline it as a single-quoted literal (an apostrophe breaks out) or a double-quoted
  raw literal (a `$(...)`/backtick executes before the script sees it); the mint ALSO fails closed on a
  newline / leading `- [pd:` in the question). It ATOMICALLY (one lock) opens the
  human `AWAIT kind=human … op=<seq>-<slug> attempt=1 need=1 got=0` STOP barrier AND mints the monotonic pd
  (seq machine-assigned + monotonic + NEVER reused, even across `resolve`; 1st = `pd:1-<slug>`, 2nd =
  `pd:2-<slug>`, …), ECHOING `pending-stop ok id=pd:<seq>-<slug>`. CAPTURE the echoed id — do NOT hand-pick
  the seq (any agent-supplied seq is ignored). **C6 — capture the FULL output and CHECK the status line
  (rc) FIRST, THEN extract the id ONLY on the ok path.** `mission-write.sh` ALWAYS exits 0 (the rc is IN
  the printed line) and `sed` emits NOTHING on a failure line, so a bare `pid=$(… | sed …)` cannot tell a
  real mint from a `FAILED rc=3/7/8/9/10-14` — proceeding on an empty `pid` is a naked yield (S1). Do:
  ```
  out=$(bash __KIT_ABS__/scripts/hooks/mission-write.sh pending-stop <sid> <root> <slug> <part> <round> <attempt> <phase> "$q" 2>&1)
  # R8r5-E6/D4 - ANCHOR to the EXACT status line `^mission-write: pending-stop ok id=pd:<seq>-<slug>` and
  # extract in ONE step. Do NOT wildcard-match `*id=pd:*` over the combined stdout+stderr: the untrusted
  # echoed question/args (or a lib diagnostic) could embed that token and SPOOF a mint on a FAILED rc.
  # PORTABLE sed only (BSD/macOS sed has NO `\b` and NO `\+`); BRE `[0-9][0-9]*` / `[a-z0-9-][a-z0-9-]*`.
  # An empty pid = no matching status line = the STOP did NOT open.
  pid=$(printf '%s\n' "$out" | sed -n 's/^mission-write: pending-stop ok id=\(pd:[0-9][0-9]*-[a-z0-9-][a-z0-9-]*\).*$/\1/p' | head -1)
  if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    : # the ONLY proceed-able path — pid is the FULL, VALIDATED pd:<seq>-<slug> (use it verbatim for resolve)
  else
    : # every FAILED rc (see the `pending-stop` fail-closed rc block) OR an empty/spoofed id => the STOP did NOT open => do NOT proceed; STOP-LOUD / surface (S1)
  fi
  ```
  — on the ok path `pid` is the FULL `pd:<seq>-<slug>` (use it verbatim for `resolve`); the barrier/DECISION `op` is `${pid#pd:}`. **R6/R7-1 — the AWAIT `op` is the echoed pd's UNIQUE
  `<seq>-<slug>`** (the `pd:` id minus the `pd:` prefix), NOT the bare `<slug>`: without the minted seq,
  two same-slug decisions would share `(part,round,attempt=1,kind,op)` and the 2nd `got=0` opener would
  inherit the 1st's already-resolved `got=1` — silently skipping the mandatory stop (unapproved autonomous
  work). The minted seq guarantees each pd a DISTINCT op → DISTINCT idtag → the barrier LANDS. The atomic
  opener fails CLOSED (no pd line, no echo) on a bad slug / over-long line / seed-arithmetic /
  sequence-exhausted / a non-`appended` AWAIT, so a partial open never leaves a phantom stop; it also
  REFUSES a SECOND open human barrier (a second one is invisible to `await-state`'s single-barrier return).
  Do NOT hand-open a separate `await` barrier (the atomic verb already opened it) and do NOT substitute
  plain `pending` (NON-BLOCKING — it does not stop the loop, §9).
  THEN stop — the outstanding `await kind=human ready=0` keeps the §8 rows parked until a real user turn.
  **Closing it (C6, D6, D14, C2):** the first turn AFTER the user answers ENTERS §12.1 and CONSUMES the
  barrier UNDER its tick lock (step 4) — NOT before entering (R6: acting outside the lock lets a queued wake
  race the resolution → double-drive). **C2 — the gated action MUST run on the SAME wake that consumes the
  DECISION; NEVER close the barrier (got=1 + resolve) while deferring the action to a later wake.** Once
  `got=1` resolves the barrier the reader (C9 keystone) DROPS it, so a deferred wake would find nothing to
  consume and the approved action would NEVER run. Under the lock, in THIS EXACT order: **(a)** record the
  outcome — `log … "[mission] DECISION op=<seq>-<slug> outcome=<approve|deny>" "pd-<seq>-decision-<slug>"`
  with the user's ACTUAL answer (the barrier stays LIVE at `got=0` with the DECISION present — the C9 reader
  keeps a human `got=0`-with-a-DECISION barrier LIVE precisely so this wake can consume it); **(b)** CONSUME
  it — `approve` ⇒ perform the idempotent gated action; `deny` ⇒ ABORT it (prose, not machine-forced — the
  ACCEPTED RESIDUAL); **(c)** append the SAME barrier with `got=1` (reuse the exact
  op/part/phase/round/attempt/need from the token) — the `await` verb REFUSES this got=1 close unless the
  same-op DECISION already exists (DECISION-first is LIB-ENFORCED, and the reader ALSO requires the DECISION
  before it reads resolved); **(d)** `resolve` the pd whose `<seq>-<slug>` matches the `await-state` token's
  `op` (an EXACT unique match — the seq removes the old slug-repeat ambiguity). The whole CONSUME
  (DECISION → action → got=1 → resolve) IS this turn's ONE transition: go to step 7 and RESCHEDULE — do NOT
  drive a further transition this turn. **C8 — exactly-once depends on the gated action's OWN
  idempotency/single-shot nature (the ACCEPTED residual):** the STOP contract does NOT persist or enforce an
  applied/aborted flag, so the agent MUST make the gated action idempotent or single-shot (an external write
  idempotent BY KEY, the same idtag/idempotencyKey-dedup invariant the bridge uses) — so a re-consume after a
  crash is an approve-replay no-op / a deny that never fires. **R1 accepted FAIL-SAFE residual:** with the
  action BEFORE `got=1`, a crash between the action and `got=1` leaves the barrier LIVE + DECISION, so the
  next wake re-CONSUMES (idempotent action re-run = re-confirm, then closes); a crash after `got=1` leaves it
  RESOLVED with the action already done. NEVER a silent bypass; both legs fail safe, which is why we do NOT
  build an applied/aborted lifecycle. Order DECISION → action → got=1 → resolve (D14/R7-3): a crash mid-close
  leaves a durable DECISION (+ maybe a RESOLVED barrier + cosmetic stale pd line, benign), NEVER a removed pd
  + a ready=0 park with no recorded outcome. R4 — the got=1 append is a DISTINCT record (the idtag ends
  `-g<GOT>`, so it does NOT overwrite the got=0 opener); `await-state` reads the newest line's got so
  `got==need=1` (with the DECISION present) reads RESOLVED — that IS the close.
- **`await kind=human ready=0`** already outstanding (a prior turn parked on the user).

An **ordinary away-policy `pending`** (a non-blocking batched question logged under §9's away default) is
NOT a stop — the loop proceeds loudly on its assumption and the epilogue reschedules as usual. Only a
MANDATORY human decision (above) parks the loop with an `AWAIT kind=human`.

**The list above is CLOSED and EXHAUSTIVE.** Anything not on it is not a stop, however finished it feels.
Named explicitly because each of these has ended a real run:
- **Finishing a unit of work is NOT a stop.** A `git commit` returning success is the single most
  common false terminal — in one observed session it ended four consecutive turns. Your private
  planning unit (build → test → mutate → commit) is FINER-GRAINED than any mission transition, so its
  completion is never a turn boundary. Generalize: **a tool result that completes your own planning
  unit is not a turn boundary.** The four "naked-yield seam" reminders in §5 are EXAMPLES, not the
  closed set of places you must not stop.
- **Writing a report is NOT a stop.** Prose describing what landed belongs at the END of a turn that
  already contains the next transition, or at a real §12.3 stop. Starting a summary does not convert
  the turn into a handback.
- **Replying to a peer window is NOT a stop.** An inbound peer message is a wake source like any
  other; it did not enter through the tick lock, so after answering it, RE-ENTER §12.1 and exit
  through step 7 like everything else. In one observed session, peer replies caused three consecutive
  naked yields.
- **Verification-completeness is not task-completeness.** A green suite + watched mutations + a clean
  typecheck + a commit is a very strong done signal for a SLICE. Check the Build Plan for the next
  item before believing it.

**Announcing an action NEVER substitutes for taking it.** Narration accompanies action in the SAME
turn; it does not replace it. If a turn's only content is a description of what you are about to do
("checkpointing next", "running the barrier now"), that turn is a NAKED YIELD and the mission is now
frozen — the observed failure is exactly this, writing "context ~84%, checkpointing next" and then
stopping instead of checkpointing. The global reply-style rule asks you to narrate intent BEFORE a
batch of tool calls; that rule presumes the batch follows in the same turn. Narration with no
following tool call is the failure, not the rule.

### 12.4 Post-compact resume composes here (no double-drive)

Post-compact resume is **just another wake source** into §12.1 — not a second state machine. Keep the
existing `(sid,nonce)` post-compact resume marker, then enter the SAME routine (tick lock → §8 read →
cursor → one transition). If the SessionStart primer AND a restored scheduled wake both fire, the
**tick lock serializes them** (D8 — the real dedup): the FIRST takes the lock and advances; the SECOND
finds the lock fresh-held and reschedules WITHOUT touching state (or, if it acquires only after the first
released, it re-reads the now-advanced state and simply picks the NEXT step — the deterministic idtags make
any re-bank an idempotent no-op). It does NOT rely on the second wake "seeing the cursor change at step 5"
(a wake that recomputes its baseline after the winner's append would read it unchanged). **Intent
precedence on resume: the PLAN zone and the LOG outrank the handoff chain's `Next Action`** (§C / §8) —
a stale handoff hint never overrides the durable on-disk position.

### 12.5 Why a dropped step 7 is unrecoverable

There is no timer, no expiring lock, and no watcher behind the continuation invariant. A turn that
ends without a successful `ScheduleWakeup` leaves the mission at its last banked state **indefinitely**,
until a human types something — which may be many hours later, and the run produces nothing in the
meantime. This is why step 7 is a gate rather than a step: the cost of dropping it is not a slow
mission, it is a dead one.
