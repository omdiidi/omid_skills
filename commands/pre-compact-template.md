<!--
HALT-ADVISORY block — included ONLY when the Step 4 detector tripped this run.
Tone: informational signal, NOT a refusal. The agent has full agency to continue if it
has a reasonable next step; the block is a heads-up. The brief explicitly rejected
"NEEDS HUMAN" framing — use "Halt Advisory."
-->
<!-- INCLUDE ONLY IF HALT_TRIPPED -->
## Halt Advisory
- Detector tripped at {halt timestamp}; reason: {halt reason}.
- This is informational; the agent has full agency. Most common clear: continue work — the
  next user reply (any input that isn't the bare `/pre-compact` invocation) will auto-clear
  the halt on the next `/pre-compact` run.
- If you are this agent and you read this on resume: surface to the user with the reason
  and a one-line summary of what was happening, then await direction. Do not silently retry
  the failing operation.

## Chain Status
- **Chain:** {chain_id first 8 chars} (full id in `~/.claude/chains/{full sid}.json`)
- **Started:** {started_at local time} · **Elapsed:** {Hh Mm or Nd Hh Mm}
- **Link:** {current_seq}
- **Status:** {active | halted (since {ts}, reason: {reason})}
- **North star:** {north_star verbatim}  (source: {arguments | brief | agent-supplied | recovered})
- **Current active task:** {first line of `## Active Task` this session — drift visible if it diverges from the north star}

**Recent chain progress** (last 5 ledger entries from `~/.claude/chains/{sid}.log`, oldest → newest):
- {ts} seq={N} next={truncated 120 chars} files={N} commits={N} status={S}
- {ts} seq={N} next={truncated 120 chars} files={N} commits={N} status={S}

## Mental Model
[2-3 lines: what this codebase is, what it does, who uses it. Ground post-compact Claude instantly.]

## Active Skill State
<!-- Populated by Step 3.G. If no skill detected, write: "No active skill detected — generic continuation. See ## Next Action below." Otherwise: -->
- Detected skill: [/plan | /implement | /discussion | /mission | /ui-audit | /god-review | /god-report | /codex-review | none]
- Phase indicator: [skill-specific, e.g. "mid review round 2", "implement Phase 3 of 5", "Phase 2 of god-review round 4 (consecutive_clean=1)"]
- Critical artifacts to preserve: [paths to in-flight files, e.g. ./tmp/ready-plans/foo.md, tmp/god-review/state.json]
- Resumption directive: [skill-specific Next Action template from Step 3.G — verbatim]
- Loop state (if applicable):
  - Exit criterion: [e.g., "3 consecutive clean rounds" for /god-review]
  - Current standing: [e.g., "1 of 3 clean; round 4 had 8 new findings"]
  - Iteration / round number: [N]
- Self-assessment (optional): confidence work is complete ~N%; unresolved doubt: [one specific concern]

## Active Task
[1-3 sentences. What the user is doing right now. Lead with $ARGUMENTS if provided.]

## Next Action
[The exact next step. File:line where the next edit goes. Command to run. Test to re-run. Make this unambiguous.]

## Build Plan
[Ordered steps for the current work. Mark each: [done] / [in progress] / [pending].]

<!-- Omit section entirely if single-thread session (no parallel work streams). -->
## Work Streams
<!-- Populate if the session touched 2 or more distinct subsystems/threads. Omit
section entirely if single-thread. Each stream gets its own ### subheading. -->
### Stream 1: <name>
- Status: in-progress | paused | blocked | done | implement chunk N of M shipped
- Files touched: [path list]
- Last known state: [1-2 lines]
- Stream-specific next action: [specific command or file:line]
- Blockers (if any): [link to Pending Externals if external]

<!-- INCLUDE ONLY IF Seq > 1. When Seq = 1, REMOVE the comment, heading, and body entirely. Do not leave a placeholder. -->
## Since Last Compact
[3-8 bullets: what got resolved, what shifted, which open questions got answered, which fix-laters now apply. Compare prior Build Plan / Next Action (held from Step 3.B) against what actually happened this session.]

## What We Tried
<!--
Cross-link propagation: parent-propagated entries (carried forward from prior links) appear
ABOVE the `<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->` marker; THIS session's new entries are appended
BELOW it. Bounded at 20 total with asymmetric retention — when over: drop oldest `kept` first,
preserve all `abandoned because <reason>` and footgun-tagged entries regardless of age. If
every entry is abandoned/footgun and the cap is breached, retain ALL (soft target, surface a
warning in the Step 9.1 report).
Chronological list of every distinct approach: hypothesis → change → result with numbers → kept | abandoned because …
-->
<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->

<!-- Omit section entirely if not applicable. -->
## Live Hypotheses
<!-- Half-formed "I suspect X but haven't proven" thinking. Omit section if none. -->
- HYPOTHESIS: [statement]
  - Evidence pointing here: [list]
  - NOT YET TRIED: [next experiment]
  - Confidence: N%

## Evidence & Data
[Raw numbers, comparison tables, before→after measurements, data file paths.
Rule: never write "improved" / "better" / "faster" without before→after numbers.]

### Surprising Discoveries
<!-- System-level facts uncovered this session. Permanent truths, not try-results.
Anti-duplication: only include here if the fact is NOT already captured
as a "→ result" line in ## What We Tried. Do not duplicate. -->
- [discovery] — [where observed] — [implication]

<!-- Omit section entirely if no reviewers ran this session. -->
## Review/Fix Loop Ledger
<!-- Per-iteration trail for sessions involving reviewers (codex/claude/impl/plan/
master/god). Omit section if no reviewers ran. -->
| Round | UTC | Reviewer(s) | Findings (crit/non-crit) | Fixes applied | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ | codex-review | 13/47 | 13 files, tests rerun | passed |
| R2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Key Decisions (This Session)
<!--
Cross-link propagation: parent-propagated decisions appear ABOVE the
`<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->` marker; THIS session's new decisions appended BELOW it.
Soft cap at 40 (drop oldest `confidence: low` first when over). Section heading retains
"This Session" wording for back-compat but body is cross-link cumulative.
Each entry: [Decision] — [reasoning] — [source: conversation | memory | git] — [confidence: high | low]
-->
<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->

## Rejected Alternatives
- [Alternative] — [why rejected]

<!-- Omit section entirely if not applicable. -->
## Footguns Discovered This Session
<!--
Operational "do not repeat" — distinct from Rejected Alternatives (design).
Cross-link propagation: parent footguns appear ABOVE the `<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->`
marker; THIS session's new ones appended BELOW. Soft cap at 30 (drop oldest first when over).
Section retains "This Session" heading for back-compat but body is cross-link cumulative.
-->
<!-- propagation-boundary v1 -->

## User Constraints (This Session)
- [Constraint stated by the user this session, verbatim or paraphrased]

<!-- Omit section entirely if not applicable. -->

<!-- Omit section entirely if not applicable. -->
## Pending Externals
<!-- External dependencies, waits, blocked-on-people, scheduled-for-later,
background tasks (run_in_background agents, scheduled wakeups). Omit if none. -->

<!-- Omit section entirely if not applicable. -->
## Deferred-for-Human Queue
<!-- Items the orchestrator deliberately punted for human attention. Distinct from
Open Issues (bugs) and Things To Fix Later (debt). HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE-style. -->

- [Any mid-session corrections, redirects, or approvals from the user]

## Where To Read More
