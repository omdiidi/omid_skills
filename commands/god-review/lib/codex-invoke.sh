#!/bin/bash
# codex-invoke.sh — Bounded wrapper around `codex exec` for god-review.
#
# Usage: bash lib/codex-invoke.sh <outfile> <prompt> <workdir>
#
#   outfile  — Path to write Codex output (written atomically via temp->mv at the end).
#   prompt   — The review prompt string (quoted by the caller).
#   workdir  — Working directory passed to `--cd`.
#
# Optional env vars (set before calling for two-account threading):
#   CODEX_HOME_1  — CODEX_HOME for primary account profile.
#   CODEX_HOME_2  — CODEX_HOME for fallback account profile (used if primary fails).
#   CODEX_BIN     — Path or name of the codex binary. Defaults to "codex".
#   GODREVIEW_INVOKE_TIMEOUT_SECS — start-to-finish deadline for the WHOLE invocation
#                   (profile fallback + lock-wait + codex). Default 3300 s.
#
# Account isolation strategy:
#   - If CODEX_HOME_1 is set: use it. On failure, try CODEX_HOME_2 if set.
#   - If neither is set: fall back to shared ~/.codex with flock serialization
#     (or mkdir-spinlock if flock unavailable) to prevent concurrent calls from
#     stomping each other's session state.
#   - If codex binary is not on PATH: write "(unavailable)" note and exit 0.
#
# Termination guarantee (why the whole wrapper is bounded, not just codex exec):
#   The real hang surface is NOT only a runaway `codex exec` — it is ALSO an unbounded
#   `flock` / mkdir-spinlock wait on the shared ~/.codex lock (a late waiter can block
#   forever behind a wedged holder). So EVERY blocking leg draws from ONE shared
#   remaining-budget deadline. `pt_run` bounds codex and kills its whole PROCESS GROUP
#   (TERM then KILL) on timeout; the lock legs are bounded by `flock -w`/a budget-checked
#   spin. On any deadline hit we write `<outfile>.status=timeout` and exit 124, so a
#   timed-out PARTIAL output is never miscounted as a completed reviewer.
#
# No router.json multi-account threading. With both CODEX_HOME_1/CODEX_HOME_2 unset, the
# default ~/.codex account is used (single account, serialized on a shared lock).
# Two-profile alternation (CODEX_HOME_1 / CODEX_HOME_2) is the maximum supported.

# flock unavailable — mkdir-spinlock fallback with stale-lock detection.
# A SIGKILLed prior run leaves the lockdir behind indefinitely; detect and remove it once its mtime
# is older than the stale threshold. I5 — that threshold MUST exceed the longest LEGIT hold.
#
# R8-5 (revert of R7-5) — the stale threshold is a FLAT _LOCK_CAP_FLOOR (21660s), NOT a per-holder
# budget read. INVOKE_TIMEOUT is clamped to [1,21600] (:63), so 21660 >= any live holder's max hold and
# a live holder is NEVER force-evicted (R7-5's goal is preserved). The round-7 `$LOCKDIR/budget` FILE is
# GONE: writing dir content broke the plain-`rmdir` reclaim protocol shared by the THREE clients of this
# lockdir (this script, ui-audit/lib, any other Codex caller) — a non-empty dir cannot be `rmdir`'d, so those
# other clients' reclaim silently failed. A stale lockdir is EMPTY again, so every client reclaims it
# with a plain `rmdir`. The only cost: a truly-dead small-budget lock lingers up to ~6h — fine for a dev lock.
#
# DEFERRED follow-up (do NOT implement here — pre-existing review-tooling debt, NOT the round-7 regression):
# ui-audit still has unbounded mkdir/flock waits and a flat/absent stale threshold that could evict a
# live long-running god-review holder; and the shared lock logic could be extracted into one shared helper.
# Both are a coordinated-moment refactor, deliberately deferred.

# a live lockdir look stale after 1 s). R8-6 — clamp the accepted range to [1,21600] (mirroring
# INVOKE_TIMEOUT at :63) so an env value like 999999 (~11.6 days) can no longer wildly inflate the
# threshold. Validate with the same anti-injection idiom BEFORE any `$(( ))`: length-guard, then base-10
# normalize, then reject out-of-range.
# M1 (round-8) — NOTE: with the range clamped to <=21600 and the floor at 21660, `_SPIN_RAISE` can NEVER
# exceed LOCK_TIMEOUT (:248 `_SPIN_RAISE > LOCK_TIMEOUT` is unreachable), so the raise is CURRENTLY INERT.
# It is retained (not deleted) as a validated, anti-injection-hardened clamp so that if the flat floor is
