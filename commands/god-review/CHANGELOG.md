# god-review changelog

## 2026-08-02 - pipeline repair: 5 dead legs between the parts

Five defects that each severed one connection in the /god-review + /god-report
chain. Every part existed; the wires between them did not.

**1. `write_env` dropped `HAS_DATABASE`.** Phase 0 computed the signal and
Phase 2a gated the `database-audit` lens on it, but the variable was absent
from `write_env`'s persisted list, so it read empty in every later block and the
lens never activated on a database repo. Added to the list in
`lib/env-helpers.sh`.

**2. The principle output contract pointed at a directory nobody read.** All 24
`principles/*.md` said "Save to `tmp/god-review/principles/<name>-findings.md`";
the orchestrator consolidated `tmp/god-review/findings/*.txt`. Every principle
agent's report landed in a directory the pipeline never opened.

Normalized on **`findings/<family>-<layer>-<name>.txt`**, and moved both sides
in the same change. `findings/` won because the family prefix is load-bearing:
Phase 2d consolidates by globbing `claude-*.txt` against `codex-*.txt`, and
Phase 2e's cross-model `(both)` promotion exists only because those globs are
disjoint. The old convention had no family prefix, so the Claude run and the
Codex run of the same principle wrote the same path and clobbered each other -
destroying the exact agreement signal the promotion pass consumes. Principle
files now write `findings/${GOD_REVIEW_AGENT_ID:-claude-principle-<name>}.txt`;
Codex principle runs are read-only sandboxed and print to stdout, which
`codex-invoke.sh` captures and the orchestrator files under `codex-principle-*`.

`write_agent_finding` is now **no-clobber**: the agent's own full report beats
the summary text an Agent call returns. Phase 3's round-start cleanup therefore
also clears `findings/claude-*.txt` (it previously cleared only `codex-*`), or a
surviving file would silently reject the next round's write.

**3. Phase 2e never read the consolidated corpus.** 2d built
`/tmp/{claude,codex}-findings-consolidated.txt` and 2e aggregated from the
orchestrator's memory of the transcript - which never contained the Codex
reviewers at all. 2e gained a STEP 0 that names the four input artifacts, reads
them, and refuses to write a report when both corpora are empty (a "zero
findings" report from an empty corpus is a false green). Consolidation also
moved out of the Codex-availability-gated block into its own always-run 2d.1, so
a Claude-only run still produces a corpus.

**4. Multi-round runs overwrote `report.md`.** Phase 2e STEP 4 now writes
`report-round-$ROUND.md`; new STEP 5 calls `lib/merge-round-reports.sh` to
derive `report.md` - a copy of the current round for /god-review's fix loop
(which must not be re-handed already-fixed findings), or a hash-deduplicated
union of all rounds when `GOD_REVIEW_MERGE_ROUNDS=true`, which is what
`/god-report --rounds N` sets. Union mode tags findings seen in 2+ rounds
`(consistent across rounds)`. Dedup key is the pipeline's existing
`sha256(file | line_range/5 | category)`, so a finding has one identity across
2e STEP 1, the merge, and Phase 3a's replay check.

**5. `--ruthless`, `--online`, `--codex-validation-every` never reached their
gates.** Root cause: Step 0 parsed them and then ended its bash block without
calling `write_env`. Each block is a fresh shell that rebuilds state from
`.env.sh`, so the parse died where it was made and every gate downstream read
empty - `--ruthless` never spawned the 4th Claude broad reviewer (fleet 9
instead of 10), `--online` never reached hallucinated-imports, and the
validation cadence silently fell back to the default. Step 0 (both commands) now
calls `write_env` and echoes the parse, followed by a fresh-shell round-trip
check. The `RUTHLESS` and `CODEX_VALIDATION_EVERY` gates now fail loud on an
unset value instead of defaulting, so this class of break cannot recur silently.

**Files:** `commands/god-review.md`, `commands/god-report.md`,
`commands/god-review/lib/env-helpers.sh`, `commands/god-review/principles/*.md`
(all 24), new `commands/god-review/lib/merge-round-reports.sh`, `README.md`.

## 2026-05-31 — 3 new open-posture Codex broad reviewers

Broad-reviewer roster grows from 4 Claude + 3 Codex to **4 Claude + 6 Codex**
(the 4th Claude is the `--ruthless`-only redteam reviewer). The 3 new Codex
reviewers use the "direct the aim, not the answer" prompt posture: each is
handed its lens's AIM plus the context for what "correct" means, instead of an
exhaustive find-this checklist.

**New files** (`broad-reviewers/`):
- `codex-deep-correctness.md` — logic correctness: wrong results, edge cases,
  broken error paths, off-by-ones, bad state transitions, unreachable/inverted
  branches.
- `codex-ruthless-redteam.md` — adversarial robustness: malicious/malformed
  input, abuse of features, hostile load/starvation, limit bypass, lying
  dependencies, degenerate/pathological cases.
- `codex-data-integrity.md` — data integrity + concurrency + resource
  lifecycle: races, TOCTOU, non-atomic multi-step writes, missing transactions,
  lost updates, double-processing, resource leaks, use-after-close, lifecycle
  ordering.

All 6 Codex lenses are mutually distinct and distinct from the original 3
(cross-layer / prod-scalability / security-safeguards). Each new reviewer keeps
the existing structured output contract (severity + category + file:line +
evidence + explanation) and a skeptic clause without over-suppressing
("ground every finding in the actual code; if you find nothing after three
honest passes, say so").

**Registration** (the orchestrator HARDCODES the Codex broad roster — it does
NOT glob the directory):
- `god-review.md` Phase 2c: added 3 new `bash lib/codex-invoke.sh` invocations
  (`/tmp/codex-broad-{deep-correctness,ruthless-redteam,data-integrity}.txt`)
  and 3 matching `cp … findings/codex-broad-*.txt` lines so Phase 2d
  consolidation reads them. Without the `cp` lines a Codex reviewer is silently
  inert (same pattern as the Phase G2 C7 fix).
- `god-review.md`: `expected_subagents` 32 → 35; frontmatter description
  "3 Codex broad" → "6 Codex broad"; Phase-2 intro "6 broad reviewers (7 with
  --ruthless)" → "9 broad reviewers (3 Claude + 6 Codex; 10 with --ruthless)";
  Message-1 spawn schedule updated (10 Agent + 13 Bash = 23; note added that the
  3 open-posture Codex calls can be moved to Message 2 to stay under the ~20
  soft cap; `--ruthless` Message 1 = 24).
- `god-report.md`: `expected_subagents` 31 → 34; frontmatter description
  "3 Codex broad" → "6 Codex broad". (god-report delegates Phase 2 to
  god-review.md, so no separate spawn block to edit.)

**Docs:** README Layer-A roster, cost profile (56→59 / 57→60 per round; typical
~39-43), and architecture diagram (`3 Claude + 6 Codex`) updated.

**Note for later (not done now):** the original 3 Codex reviewers
(cross-layer, prod-scalability, security-safeguards) still use the rigid
checklist style. They could be migrated to the open-posture opener for
consistency in a future pass; left untouched here per scope.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase G5+G6: convergence on production-readiness

Phase E v6 found 5 cat / 20 high; G5 closed those. Phase E v7 found 3 cat /
12 high; G6 closes those. Trajectory: 100→74→88→65→51 (de-duped actionable).

**G6 catastrophic fixes:**
- **Consolidated cat moved before skip-check.** `/tmp/claude-findings-consolidated.txt`
  and codex-findings-consolidated.txt are now refreshed every round, regardless
  of whether Codex validation runs. Was: skipped rounds left stale consolidated
  files; FP extraction recorded garbage from prior rounds.
- **FP extraction regex aligned across both sides.** idx-builder regex now
  captures full first-line as `fid` (matches validator-output parser); both
  accept `File|Location|Evidence` prefixes. FPs now record real file/line/
  category; future rounds' replay-skip filters them by accurate hash.
- **HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE template removed from Phase 2e.** Final report's
  HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE section is now written exclusively by the Phase 4
  cat-append from the accumulator file. Was: Phase 2e wrote a placeholder
  header AND Phase 4 cat-appended → duplicate `## HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE` headings.

**G6 high-severity fixes:**
- **Architect-malformed path now records finding hash.** Without this, repeated
  bad JSON output triggered indefinite re-attempt until churn-freeze fired.
- **`is_already_session_deferred_by_hash` switched to python3** (was BSD grep
  with literal-tab regex — silent no-op on macOS).
- **Post-decision state.json persist** added after the prose increment of
  `CONSECUTIVE_CLEAN_ROUNDS` and `ROUND`. Was: state.json had stale values
  on `--resume`, dropping one round.

**G5 catastrophic fixes (recap):**
- Round-start codex-*.txt cleanup gated on RE_ENTERED_PHASE_2 (was wiping
  stable Codex output on no-Phase-2 re-entry branch)
- Backstops route through LOOP_EXIT/LOOP_EXIT_CODE; Phase 4 `exit ${LOOP_EXIT_CODE:-0}`
  after final report (was bare exit N — final report never written)
- VERIFIER_NEW injected into "## Important [should fix]" canonical section
  (was phantom "## Verifier round N additions" that 3a doesn't parse)
- Codex FP extraction reads consolidated metadata for real file/line/category
- HG_QUEUE heading aligned (canonical: "## HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE")

**G5 high fixes (recap):** TSV regex accepts `Location|File|Evidence`;
HG_QUEUE accumulator cleared on fresh start (preserved on --resume); phantom
round-N-findings.md replaced with state.json.round_finding_counts ref;
exit code 3 README aligned with code (frozen-units cap); CHANGELOG `git tag`
claim clarified (plan baseline only); LOOP_EXIT_CODE + RE_ENTERED_PHASE_2
in write_env whitelist.

**T10 verification (post-G6):**
- 17/17 glob self-test
- Consolidated cat at line 695 BEFORE skip-check at line 698
- FP regex accepts File|Location|Evidence
- Phase 2e no longer pre-writes ## HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE
- Architect-malformed records finding_history_hash
- is_already_session_deferred_by_hash uses python3 (BSD-grep-safe)
- Post-decision state.json re-persist present

## 2026-05-06 — Phase G4: post-v5 catastrophic + high cluster

Phase E v5 audit (5 verifier agents) flagged 6 catastrophic + 20 high. G4
closes the cluster. Architecture is stable now; remaining items are mediums.

**Catastrophic fixes:**
- **Round-start cleanup target directory fix.** `rm -f` now hits
  `$WORKDIR/tmp/god-review/findings/verifier-*.txt` (where `write_agent_finding`
  actually writes), not the wrong `/tmp/verifier-*.txt`. Prior-round verifier
  outputs no longer leak across rounds.
- **`exit 0` semantics clarified in Phase 3e prose.** Explicit instruction
  that `exit 0` ends one bash fence, not the round/loop. Orchestrator continues
  to next prose+fence pair (or next finding).
- **CODEX_VALIDATION_EVERY actually gates.** Skip-check added before Codex
  validation invocation: `if ROUND >= 2 && ROUND % EVERY != 0 then skip`.
  Cost optimization for long runs is real.
- **VERIFIER_NEW findings now persisted to report.md.** New round-aware
  section (`## Verifier round $ROUND additions`) appended after each filter
  pass. Round N+1's 3a re-parses these as findings. Was: stdout-only,
  discoveries vanished after one round.
- **HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE write switched to separate accumulator file.** Replaced
  fragile python string-replace (which corrupts on diff content containing
  the marker text) with `tmp/god-review/human-gate-queue.md` accumulator,
  concatenated into final report.md at Phase 4 end-of-run.
- **Codex validation output now actually parsed.** `/tmp/codex-validation-output.txt`
  is grep'd for `FALSE_POSITIVE` lines; each fires `record_false_positive`
  AND `record_finding_hash` (so future rounds' replay-skip filters them).
  Was: file written, never read.

**High-severity fixes:**
- **TOTAL_OPEN_FINDINGS recomputed at start of each round 3g** (was frozen
  at Phase 3 entry; record_round_counts persisted stale value).
- **FROZEN_UNITS_CAP enforced.** Exit code 3 fires when `FROZEN_UNITS_COUNT >
  FROZEN_UNITS_CAP`. Documented but unimplemented before.
- **LOOP_EXIT set on all backstops** (wall-clock, instability, frozen-cap,
  max-rounds). Postmortem can distinguish convergence from kill via state.json.
- **`git add -- "$ARCH_FILE"`** instead of `git add -A` at commit (prevents
  folding user's WIP into god-review commits).
- **TSV parser regex requires explicit `File:`/`Evidence:` prefix.** Avoids
  grabbing path-shaped substrings from prose / quoted code samples.
- **Spawn-schedule "principles 17-23"** corrected to "18-23" with explicit
  Message 1/2 coverage notes.
- **Deprecated `is_already_session_deferred` (category-only)** removed from
  `lib/env-helpers.sh`. Only `is_already_session_deferred_by_hash` remains.
  Self-flagged by dead-code-conservatism principle in v4.
- **`NET_NEW_FINDINGS_THIS_ROUND` confusion-bomb** removed (vestigial; only
  `NEW_NEW_FINDINGS` is wired; the named-similar pair was already removed in
  G3 init but the `record_round_counts` reference path is now consistent).
- **6 more vars added to write_env whitelist:** SKIP_CODEX_VALIDATION,
  PERF_REGRESS_PCT, INSTABILITY_RATE, FROZEN_UNITS_CAP, SHRINKAGE_PCT,
  SECRET_LEN_FLOOR, TEST_FILE_LINE_FLOOR (Tunable Constants now persist
  across fences as well).

**T10 verification (post-G4):** 17/17 globs pass, 4 LOOP_EXIT backstops,
SKIP_CODEX_VALIDATION wired, FROZEN_UNITS_CAP enforced (2 sites:
declaration + check), VERIFIER_NEW appended to report.md, HG_QUEUE_FILE
accumulator at 3 sites, deprecated session-deferred function removed.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase G3: residual fix-pass post Phase E v4

Phase E v4 audit on Phase G2 found 5 catastrophic + 21 high-severity items
(down from 9+31 in v3). G3 closes the remaining cluster.

**Catastrophic fixes:**
- **3b triage now uses `is_already_session_deferred_by_hash`** instead of the
  deprecated category-only variant. One weak deferral no longer suppresses an
  entire principle's coverage for the rest of the session.
- **3f verifier filter now has concrete TSV producer prose.** The orchestrator
  is given a python3 block that parses each verifier-N.txt markdown into TSV
  rows (`finding_id\tfile\tline_range_normalized\tcategory`) before the filter
  bash reads them. Was pseudocode; now executable.
- **Stale-file cleanup at round start.** Removes prior round's
  `architect-output-*.json`, `/tmp/verifier-*`, `/tmp/codex-*` before the
  new round produces fresh ones. Eliminates cross-round leak.
- **README dotfiles smoke-test now uses `/god-report`** (was `/god-review`,
  contradicting the Repo Restrictions section).

**High-severity fixes:**
- **god-review.md:619 "(all 19)" residual** updated to "(all 23)".
- **`editor-agent.md` rewritten** to read from `$ARCH_OUTPUT_FILE` path
  instead of expecting inline JSON. Matches Phase G2's disk-based Architect
  output protocol. Output now: single line `APPLIED: <file>:<lines>`.
- **6 new vars added to `write_env` whitelist:** `FINDING_DESCRIPTION`,
  `FINDING_ROOT_CAUSE`, `FINDING_SEVERITY`, `FINDING_PROPOSED_DIFF`,
  `LOOP_EXIT`, `VERIFIER_NEW_COUNT`.
- **`NET_NEW_FINDINGS_THIS_ROUND`** removed from `write_env` whitelist and
  init (vestigial confusion-bomb — `NEW_NEW_FINDINGS` is the wired counter).
- **Exit code 1 redocumented** as "Argument-parse error" (was the stale
  "report-only mode completed" — `--report-only` was dropped in Phase G).
- **Exit code 3 marked reserved** (no code path emits it).
- **README "Layer A — Broad Reviewers (6 total)"** acknowledges 7th with
  `--ruthless`.

**T10 verification (post-G3):** 17/17 globs pass, 0 "all 19" residuals,
0 deprecated `is_already_session_deferred` callers in 3b, 0 vestigial
`NET_NEW_FINDINGS_THIS_ROUND`, ARCH_OUTPUT_FILE pattern in place, smoke-test
points at /god-report.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase G2: catastrophic fix-pass on Phase G

Phase E v3 audit (5 verifier agents) found 9 catastrophic bugs in Phase G's
implementation (architecture was sound; execution had real bugs). G2 closes
all 9 + 6 high-severity items.

**Catastrophic fixes (9):**
- **C1 ARCH_OUTPUT capture from disk, not paste.** Architect now writes JSON to
  `tmp/god-review/architect-output-<finding_id>.json`. The orchestrator reads
  from disk via `python3 ... open(ARCH_OUTPUT_FILE)`. Eliminates the
  apostrophe-corrupts-fix bug from inline-paste pattern.
- **C2 `--ruthless` real Agent invocation.** Replaced comment-only stub with
  concrete cat-prompt-to-disk + orchestrator-instruction prose for spawning
  the 4th broad-Claude reviewer. Phase F's claimed fix was illusory; G2 ships
  the real thing.
- **C3 cross-fence persistence.** Added 17 Phase 3 vars to `write_env`
  whitelist: PRE_FIX_REF, PRE_FIX_REFTYPE, PRE_FIX_BASE_REF, ARCH_FILE,
  ARCH_OUTPUT_FILE, FINDING_HASH, FINDING_ID, FINDING_FILE,
  FINDING_LINE_RANGE, FINDING_LINE_NORMALIZED, FINDING_CATEGORY, RATIONALE,
  GATES_PASS, GATE_FAIL_REASON, REGRESSION, REGRESSION_REASON, REVERT_REASON,
  NEW_NEW_FINDINGS, DEFERRED_THIS_ROUND, GATED_THIS_ROUND, ROUNDS. Replay-guard
  now records non-empty hashes; revert paths use real file paths; commit
  messages include the Architect's actual rationale.
- **C4 HAS_BENCH_SCRIPT python paren imbalance.** Phase F claimed to fix this
  in commit 64d5e98 but the `print(next((...),'')` was still missing a close
  paren. G2 actually fixes it. Verified via live python3 invocation.
- **C5 Loop re-entry prose strengthened.** Sub-step 3g now has explicit
  "YOU MUST START THE NEXT ROUND RIGHT NOW BY EXECUTING SUB-STEP 3a IN A NEW
  BATCH OF MESSAGES" instruction (orchestrator-driven re-entry pattern).
  Distinguishes converged-exit vs re-enter cases concretely.
- **C6 PRE_FIX_BASE_REF=$REF at round start.** Defined at sub-step 3a entry
  via `git rev-parse HEAD`. The 3f verifier diff now has a real baseline.
- **C7 Codex output consolidation.** After codex-broad bash invocations,
  outputs are copied from `/tmp/codex-broad-*.txt` to
  `findings/codex-broad-*.txt`. Same for codex-principle. Phase 2d cat now
  globs both `claude-*.txt` AND `codex-*.txt`. The Claude-validates-Codex
  validation pass gets real input (was reading empty before).
- **C8 god-report.md `allowed-tools`.** Added `Agent` permission. Single-
  principle delegation no longer broken from day one.
- **C9 README purge `--fix`/`--loop` invocation examples.** Updated 8
  invocation examples + 4 section headers to reflect Phase G's always-on
  fix-loop. Copy-pasting README commands no longer hits "unknown flag".

**High-severity fixes (6):**
- **`is_already_session_deferred_by_hash`** added (per-finding granularity).
  The category-only variant was too coarse — one weak deferral suppressed an
  entire principle's coverage.
- **session-deferred file format** changed to TSV: `HASH=<h>\tCATEGORY=<c>\tREASON=<r>`.
  Enables exact-hash lookup. Old grep-by-category retained for back-compat.
- **Auto-defer regex hardened.** Added stop-list of casual camelCase/snake_case
  words (`thisFeature`, `tooHard`, `cantFix`, etc.) that must not count as
  structural anchors. Prose-soup deferrals like "thisFeature is hard to fix
  because it is complex" now correctly rejected.
- **DEFERRED_THIS_ROUND / GATED_THIS_ROUND counters** incremented in 3c (per
  HUMAN_GATE first-emit) and 3d (per accepted auto-defer). `record_round_counts`
  now writes real numbers instead of hardcoded 0.
- **3f verifier filter** is now concrete bash (was pseudocode in prose).
  Reads `/tmp/verifier-all-findings.tsv`, computes hashes, applies the
  3-clause filter (human_gate_emitted + finding_history_hashes + session-
  deferred-by-hash), exports `VERIFIER_NEW_COUNT`.
- **god-review.md "19 principles" residuals purged.** Frontmatter description,
  Phase 2 spawn schedule (now 23 with explicit list), report template
  "(N of 23)". README and CRITERIA already correct.

**T10 verification (post-G2):** 17/17 globs pass, 9 helpers exist,
0 placeholder strings, 0 `--fix`/`--loop` arg-parser refs, 0 `$LOOP`/`$FIX`
residuals, both commands registered, auto-defer rejects camelCase prose-soup,
counters wired.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase G: split + orchestrator-driven loop

The biggest architectural change since v1 ship. Split `/god-review` into two
top-level commands and rewrote Phase 3 from pseudocode to a real
orchestrator-driven loop.

**Two commands, one backbone:**
- **`/god-review`** — Phase 0–3, autonomous indefinite fix-loop. Always-on by
  definition. Drops `--fix`/`--loop`/`--report-only` flags. Runs until 3
  consecutive rounds yield zero NEW non-deferred findings. `--max-wall-hours 0`
  disables the wall-clock backstop for true indefinite runs.
- **`/god-report`** (NEW) — Phase 0–2 only, single-pass review. Optional
  `--rounds N` for de-noising. Delegates Phase 0/1/2 mechanics to god-review.md
  to prevent drift; explicitly skips Phase 3.

**Phase 3 architecture rewrite:**
- Replaced ~600 lines of pseudocode-with-placeholder-strings with an
  orchestrator-driven loop.
  Bash blocks do mechanical work; Agent tool calls do parallel review/fix
  work; the loop control flow lives in the orchestrating LLM's reasoning as
  explicit prose ("if NEW > 0 → re-enter Phase 2/3; if 3 clean → exit").
- 8 sub-steps: 3a (load+hash), 3b (4-bucket triage), 3c (HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE
  batch), 3d (auto-defer with guardrails), 3e (per-finding pipeline:
  snapshot → Architect → validate → Editor → gates → perf → commit), 3f
  (verifier sub-pass with hash-dedup against human_gate_emitted +
  session-deferred), 3g (termination decision), 3h (Phase 4 final report).
- **Skip-Phase-2-when-verifier-clean** optimization: avoids respawning 52
  agents per round when nothing actionable changed.

**State.json schema additions (5 new fields):**
- `human_gate_emitted` — HUMAN_GATE batch dedup. Now actually written.
- `frozen_added_per_round` — instability detector input. Now actually written.
- `architect_malformed_per_round` — instability detector input. Now actually written.
- `auto_deferred` — audit trail for runtime deferrals.
- `round_finding_counts` — per-round summary for termination decision.
- Removed: `consecutive_no_change_rounds` (vestigial — Phase F).

**8 new helpers in `lib/env-helpers.sh`:**
- `record_human_gate_emit`, `is_human_gate_already_emitted`
- `record_frozen`, `record_architect_malformed`
- `record_auto_defer` (with substantive-reason guardrail: ≥30 chars + structural
  anchor — file path, identifier, quoted name, or issue ref. Trivial reasons
  rejected with diagnostic.)
- `is_already_session_deferred`, `record_round_counts`, `write_agent_finding`,
  `check_phase_drift`.

**Glob algorithm + hard-gates fixes:**
- `glob_to_regex` algorithm: middle-position `**` now emits `/(?:.*/)?` (was
  `(?:/.*)?` which incorrectly matched `.github/workflows.yml` against
  `.github/workflows/**/*.yml`). Self-test: 17/17 pass (was 8/8).
- `lib/hard-gates.txt`: changed `**.yml` → `**/*.yml`; added nested-quarantine
  patterns (`**/_deprecated/**`, `**/tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**`,
  `**/spec/**`).

**Replay-guard correctness fix:**
- `record_finding_hash` now called on REVERT path only (per Phase E v2
  high-severity finding). Successful fixes can now be re-attempted on later
  regression — they're tracked in `kept_fixes` only.

**Auto-defer pipeline:**
- Runtime deferrals write to `tmp/god-review/known-deferred-session.txt`
  (NOT the committed `lib/known-deferred.txt`). Promotion to the committed
  file happens explicitly at end-of-run in Phase 4. This avoids polluting
  the dotfiles repo with mid-run auto-sync commits per deferral.

**HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE batching:**
- Hard-gate findings (schema/auth/deps/secrets/CI/tests/multi-file) never
  auto-apply AND never block the loop. They append to a `HUMAN_GATE_QUEUE`
  section in `report.md` with proposed diffs, dedup'd by hash via
  `human_gate_emitted`. Presented as one batch at end of run.

**editor-agent.md output schema:**
- Required machine-parseable single-line output: `APPLIED: <file>:<lines>`
  or `EDITOR_ABORT: <reason>`. Anything else is treated as malformed and
  the fix is reverted.

**Phase 2c per-agent finding write:**
- Orchestrator-instruction prose now explicitly tells the LLM to call
  `write_agent_finding <agent_name> <result_text>` after each parallel batch
  returns, so `findings/claude-*.txt` are actually written before the
  Phase 2d cat-consolidate read (Phase E v2 catastrophic finding C4).

**Injection guard upgraded to python3:**
- macOS bash 3.2.57's `$'\n'` evaluates to literal backslash-n; the previous
  bash-`case` injection guard didn't actually filter newlines. Replaced with
  python3-based check that handles all forbidden chars + path-escape detection
  via `os.path.realpath`.

**Other:**
- Frontmatter `description` and `argument-hint` updated for the always-on
  fix-loop reality.
- README rewritten to document both commands + their flag tables side-by-side.
- Removed vestigial `FIX` and `LOOP` from `write_env` whitelist.
- Phase G implementation plan's baseline is now tracked via `git tag
  phase-g-baseline` (survives auto-push cleanup cycles). The orchestrator's
  Phase 1 snapshot still uses `git stash create` for dirty trees and
  `git rev-parse HEAD` for clean — that's a per-run snapshot, not a
  multi-day plan baseline, so stash works fine there.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase F production hardening

Closed all 15 remaining open findings from `tmp/god-review/report-v2.md`
(7 medium + 8 minor). State.json fields now actually written; hard-gate list
deduplicated to a single canonical source; cost arithmetic corrected.

**State.json wiring (was init-only):**
- `finding_history_hashes`: now written at end of Phase 3 keep/revert block via
  new `compute_finding_hash` + `record_finding_hash` helpers in
  `lib/env-helpers.sh`. Replay-guard added at fix-decision time
  (`is_finding_replayed`) — same-hash findings already tried-and-reverted
  are skipped instead of retried.
- `false_positives`: now written by Phase 2d FP post-processing via new
  `record_false_positive` helper.
- `consecutive_no_change_rounds`: removed from schema (vestigial — termination
  uses `consecutive_clean_rounds`).

**Hard-gate deduplication (was inlined in 4 places):**
- `lib/editor-agent.md`: inline pattern list replaced with pointer to
  `lib/hard-gates.txt` + `is_hard_gate` (the runtime authority).
- `god-review.md` (Reference: Hard Gates section): same.
- `README.md` (Hard Gates — Never Auto-Applied section): same.
- Canonical source remains `lib/hard-gates.txt`.

**Documentation accuracy:**
- README cost arithmetic corrected: 54 max (55 with `--ruthless`), not 47.
  Decomposes to 3 broad-Claude + 3 broad-Codex + 23 principle pairs (46) +
  2 batched validation = 54.

**Code hygiene:**
- Duplicate `is_hard_gate()` definition deleted from `lib/env-helpers.sh`
  (lines 94-109 — dead first definition + bridging "override" comment).
- `LOCK_TIMEOUT` in `lib/codex-invoke.sh` now reads `SPINLOCK_TIMEOUT_SEC`
  env var (was hardcoded 600).
- `SPINLOCK_TIMEOUT_SEC` and `LATE_IMPORT_LINE` exported at top of Phase 3
  round-loop fence + added to `write_env` whitelist (cross-fence persistence).
- `LATE_IMPORT_LINE` actually wired into `principles/circular-deps.md`
  (was declared in Tunable Constants but unused).
- `PRE_SCAN_HALLUCINATED` actually assigned (Phase 1 pre-scan was running
  but echoing to stdout; now captured into the var + counted in
  `PRE_SCAN_FLAG_COUNT`).
- Tunable Constants fence in `god-review.md` now sources `env-helpers.sh`
  for uniform fence pattern.

**No-ops** (already fixed in fix-pass v2 / not re-fixed):
- Step 0.5 `--principle <name>` error message already lists all 23 principles.
- `MAX_ROUNDS_EXPLICIT` already wired into bounded-mode termination at
  `god-review.md:1264`.
- `claude-ruthless-redteam.md` 30/40/30 effort budget already in body
  (Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3 sections).

## 2026-05-06 — Phase E fix pass
- Fixed Phase 3 while-loop split-across-fences (catastrophic)
- Fixed glob_to_regex algorithm + added self-test (catastrophic)
- Wired --ruthless spawn block to actual Agent invocation (catastrophic)
- Added round-loop counters to write_env whitelist
- Wired 4 new failure-class principles (dead-end, info-loss, contradiction, gap) into ALWAYS_ON_PRINCIPLES
- Fixed HAS_BENCH_SCRIPT python paren imbalance (audit was wrong, ast.parse confirmed)
- Fixed FROZEN_UNITS_CAP self-referential default
- Renamed phantom ARCH_JSON references to ARCH_OUTPUT

## 2026-05-05 — Initial fix pass + 4 new failure-class lenses
- 21 commits across Wave 1 + Wave 2 (Implementer S Groups 1-4)

## 2026-05-04 — Initial /god-review v1 ship
