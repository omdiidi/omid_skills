name: "Base Plan Template v2 - Context-Rich with Validation Loops"
description: "Reusable plan template loaded by /plan as the base structure for new implementation plans."
---

## Purpose

Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context
and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative
refinement.

## Core Principles

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

[What needs to be built - be specific about the end state and desires]

## Summary

[3-5 lines summarizing what ships, what areas change, and the overall approach]

## Intent / Why

- [Business value and user impact]
- [Integration with existing features]
- [Problems this solves and for whom]
- [What must remain true even if implementation details change]

## Source Artifacts

- Brief / intent artifact: [path to the normalized brief snapshot or canonical brief]
- Research dossier: [path to the supporting dossier]

## What

[User-visible behavior and technical requirements]

### Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcomes]

## Verified Repo Truths

Only include facts verified in the current repo state. This section must contain
existing files only. No proposed files, pseudocode, or speculative statements.

Use only the subsections relevant to this codebase. Rename or omit subsections
that do not apply.

### Data / State

- Fact: [Current-state claim]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Implication: [Why this matters for the plan]
  Search Evidence: [Required only for negative/absence claims]

### Entry Points / Integrations

- Fact: [Current-state claim]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Implication: [Why this matters for the plan]
  Search Evidence: [Required only for negative/absence claims]

### Execution / Async Flow

- Fact: [Current-state claim]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Implication: [Why this matters for the plan]
  Search Evidence: [Required only for negative/absence claims]

### Frontend / UI

- Fact: [Current-state claim]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Implication: [Why this matters for the plan]
  Search Evidence: [Required only for negative/absence claims]

### Shared Types / Exports

- Fact: [Current-state claim]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Implication: [Why this matters for the plan]
  Search Evidence: [Required only for negative/absence claims]

## Locked Decisions

- [Design/product decisions already settled by the brief or user]
- [Non-goals / guardrails that the implementation must not silently weaken]

## Known Mismatches / Assumptions

- Mismatch: [Repo-vs-brief mismatch, or explicit assumption]
  Repo Evidence: [path:line-line, plus search evidence if needed]
  Requirement Evidence: [brief text, user request, or external source]
  Planning Decision: [How the plan resolves the mismatch]
- [Write `None` if there are none]

## Critical Codebase Anchors

Use this section to preserve the highest-value anchors imported from the
supporting research dossier. Be selective: keep only the anchors that
materially reduce implementation risk.

- Anchor: [existing repo path, subsystem, or flow]
  Evidence: [path:line-line]
  Reuse / Watch for: [specific pattern, invariant, or constraint]

## All Needed Context

### Documentation & References

List only concrete repo files or external docs that materially reduce
implementation risk. Delete unused lines instead of leaving examples behind.

- Repo reference: [existing repo path]
  Why: [pattern, behavior, or caveat to keep in mind]
- External doc: [official URL]
  Section: [specific section if relevant]
  Why: [what it clarifies]
  Critical insight: [key constraint or gotcha]

### Files Being Changed

A single tree of every file this plan touches, with a marker showing what happens to each:

```
[Tree of all affected files, each marked with ← NEW, ← MODIFIED, or ← DELETED]
[Annotate each entry as existing or new when useful for clarity]
```

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

Write concrete gotchas only. If there are none, write `None`.

- [Concrete repo, library, runtime, or product gotcha and why it matters]

## Reconciliation Notes

Document only what materially changed because of the supporting research
dossier. Keep this concise. If the dossier added nothing beyond the draft plan,
write `None`.

- Added from dossier: [anchor, doc, or gotcha imported into the final plan]
- Conflict resolved: [plan-vs-dossier disagreement and repo-verified resolution]
- Intentionally dropped: [duplicate or low-value material removed from the final plan]

## Delta Design

For each subsection, keep existing behavior separate from proposed change.
Use only the subsections relevant to this codebase. Rename or omit subsections
that do not apply.

## Implementation Blueprint

Structure this section top-down: start with the big picture, then zoom into specifics.

### Architecture Overview

High-level pseudocode showing how the pieces fit together — data flow, component relationships, API contracts. The reader should understand the overall approach before seeing any file-level details.

For simple features (e.g. a single endpoint + UI page), a 2-3 sentence summary is sufficient. Reserve detailed architecture overviews for plans that introduce new data flows, new services, or cross-cutting changes.

### Key Pseudocode

Focus on the **hot spots** — critical logic, tricky integration points, non-obvious decisions. Don't write pseudocode for straightforward CRUD or boilerplate.

```typescript
// Pseudocode with CRITICAL details - don't write entire code
```

### Data Models and Structure

```typescript
Examples:
 - Data model / schema definitions from the repo's actual source of truth
 - Validation schemas / request contracts from the project's actual validation layer
 - Shared interfaces / types / export hubs used by this codebase
 - API request/response types or other integration contracts
```

### Tasks (in implementation order)

Repeat this block once per task. Remove this instruction in the final plan.

Task [number]:
Goal:
- [What this task unlocks]
Files:
- MODIFY [existing repo path]
- CREATE [new repo path]
Pattern to copy:
- [existing repo path]
Gotchas:
- [Critical caveat]
Definition of done:
- [Observable completion state]

### Integration Points

List only the concrete integration points this change touches. Delete any
category that does not apply.

- Data / schema source of truth: [actual file or directory discovered during the repo audit]
- Entry points to extend: [actual route, command, worker, event, or bootstrap entrypoint]
- Validation layer: [actual library, middleware, or contract pattern used by this repo]
- Domain / service layer: [actual file or directory pattern used by this codebase]
- User-facing / operator-facing surface: [actual page, view, command, or workflow]
- Shared types / export hubs: [actual shared locations if cross-boundary types are needed]
- External / operational hooks: [actual cron, queue, webhook, env, or admin surface if applicable]

## Validation

```bash
# Run these FIRST - fix any errors before proceeding
npm run lint               # ESLint and Prettier
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript compilation
# Expected: No errors. If errors, READ the error and fix.
```

### Assumption Gates

List the exact `scripts/<feature>-assumptions/run-all.sh` paths whose assumption
tests guard this plan. `/implement` runs every listed gate BEFORE the first
chunk, AFTER each shipped chunk, and once more at end-of-implementation; a FAIL
halts implementation. Write `none` when this plan has no assumption-test gates.

- [scripts/<feature>-assumptions/run-all.sh — or `none`]

### Factuality Checks

- `Verified Repo Truths` uses `Fact / Evidence / Implication` for every bullet
- Every negative claim also includes `Search Evidence`
- No proposal/future language appears in `Verified Repo Truths`
- No placeholder/template strings remain in the final plan
- Every `MODIFY` path exists

### Manual Checks

- Scenario: [Manual scenario]
  Expected: [Expected user-visible or operational result]

## Open Questions

- [Write `None` if there are none]

## Final Validation Checklist

- [ ] No linting errors: `npm run lint`
- [ ] No type errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Shared types / contracts are exported from the codebase's actual shared hubs if needed
- [ ] Verified Repo Truths contains only checked facts
- [ ] Every verified fact includes exact evidence
- [ ] Every negative claim includes search evidence
- [ ] No proposal language appears in `Verified Repo Truths`
- [ ] Every `MODIFY` path exists in the repo
- [ ] No template/example placeholders remain
- [ ] High-value anchors/docs/gotchas from the supporting dossier were reconciled into the final plan or intentionally dropped
- [ ] Any plan-vs-dossier factual conflicts were resolved or surfaced explicitly
- [ ] Entry points and integration points match the current repo structure discovered during the audit
- [ ] No unresolved factual blockers remain from review

## Deprecated / Removed Code

- [Code paths to delete or simplify as part of the change]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't mix verified repo facts with proposed changes
- Don't cite unverified file paths or line anchors
- Don't make negative claims without search evidence
- Don't let "likely", "seems", or inferred future behavior masquerade as verified fact
- Don't let template placeholders survive into the final plan
- Don't paste the supporting dossier wholesale into the final plan
- Don't silently choose between conflicting plan and dossier claims without re-checking the repo
- Don't invent new integration points when an existing route/bootstrap/service/module entrypoint should be extended
- Don't invent approximate code patterns when the repo already has exact ones
- Don't create new patterns when existing ones work
- Don't skip validation because "it should work"
- Don't mix async/await with callbacks
- Don't hardcode values that should be in .env
- Don't catch all errors — be specific with error types
- Don't create new files when editing existing ones works
